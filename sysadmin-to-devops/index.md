# Sysadmin to DevOps - My PowerShell ignited story


{{< youtube lISZZ9R2ljU >}}

My story on how I turned from Sysadmin to DevOps engineer, with PowerShell driving my journey!

It's crazy to think that 5 years ago I couldn't code, and one tweet simply started a snowball effect on my career. 

I wanted to document this moment in my life as I've passed Azure DevOps engineer exam and been working as DevOps engineer - something I wouldn't even about thinking without PowerShell and its great community.

Join me in my story, and please share your own story - whether you're just starting, or you are already there! There's nothing better than listening to real life stories!

For that purpose you’d need to use an archiver manager like 7-zip. Once installed, use 7-zip to open the installation file, and if you can find *.inf files inside, extract everything where needed.</p><p>7-zip download page: <a href=http://www.7-zip.org/download.html>http://www.7-zip.org/download.html</a></p><h3 id=if-the-above-ways-failed>If the above ways failed<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#if-the-above-ways-failed>#</a></h3><p>Then manufacturer for some reason made it difficult to you, but we still have a few ways of tracking where the actual files went.</p><p>You can often find files in:</p><ul><li>Root of system drive</li><li>Root of other partition</li><li>In Windows\Temp directory</li></ul><p>While browsing through the folders set your folder view to details and make the most recent files appear on top. You can even use Windows Search and specify last modification time to when you start installation and search for *.inf files.</p><p>Finally, you can use resource monitor to track where installation files makes changes to the hard drive.</p><p>You can also, export already installed drivers. While it’s really convenient, it’s not always that easy to find all drivers once deployed. I always would like you to have a full picture of the whole process.</p><h2 id=install-the-drivers>Install the drivers<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#install-the-drivers>#</a></h2><p>Now we can carry on with installation. But before doing so, I’d like you to open C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository folder and sort folders by “Date modified”, with the most recent on top. Note the time when you start the installation.</p><p>Once the installation of your drivers is commenced, you will notice as new folders are being created – these are drivers needed by your hardware. You can open these folders and see that there are plenty of files.</p><p class="jetpack-slideshow-noscript robots-nocontent">This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p><div id=gallery-1098-15-slideshow class="slideshow-window jetpack-slideshow slideshow-black" data-trans=fade data-autostart=1 data-gallery='[{"src":"https:\/\/kamilpro.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Driver-Instal-6.jpg","id":"1110","title":"Driver-Instal-6","alt":"","caption":"","itemprop":"image"},{"src":"https:\/\/kamilpro.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Driver-Instal-5.jpg","id":"1109","title":"Driver-Instal-5","alt":"","caption":"","itemprop":"image"},{"src":"https:\/\/kamilpro.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Driver-Instal-7.jpg","id":"1111","title":"Driver-Instal-7","alt":"","caption":"","itemprop":"image"},{"src":"https:\/\/kamilpro.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Driver-Instal-8.jpg","id":"1112","title":"Driver-Instal-8","alt":"","caption":"","itemprop":"image"}]' itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageGallery></div><p>You can notice that those folders have a naming convention – <span style=color:#396>name.inf</span><span style=color:#00f><em>architecture</em></span>randomnumbers.

The files I’m going to look for are:</p><ul><li>Nv_dispi.inf</li><li>Basicrender.inf</li><li>Nvstusb.inf</li><li>Nvhda.inf</li></ul><p>If you’ve read my post about <a href=https://kamilpro.com/mastering-pnputil-add-drivers-windows-image/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Mastering PNPUTIL</a>, then you’ll know how to use this tool to add drivers to your image. Otherwise, stay with me.</p><h1 id=on-your-windows-image>On your Windows image<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#on-your-windows-image>#</a></h1><p>Let’s armour now the image in the right drivers we’ve just acquired. You will obviously need to make them available to the image, either by shared folder or copy/paste. I simply copied all installation files to C:\Temp\NVidia folder. Keep this folder open as we’re going to need it very soon. Like in 2 paragraphs soon.</p><p>I’m going to show you now 2 ways of installing drivers – with GUI and command line.</p><p>On the side note: if you’d like to confirm the files are being added to the driver store, simply open another Windows Explorer window and head towards C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository like you did on your physical machine as you did before.</p><h3 id=add-drivers-with-gui>Add drivers with GUI<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#add-drivers-with-gui>#</a></h3><p>While still in the folder with the drivers, simply type in the Search Box the filename of the first *.inf file of which I’ve asked you earlier on. In my case it is: Nv_dispi.inf. It should show up only one file. Now you’d like to right click the file, and choose Install.</p><p>Once completed you should receive a message stating that operation was successful.</p><p>Repeat the process for all drivers you need and that’s it – your image will come with drivers and system will install them automatically when hardware is detected.</p><p>You can confirm it by either going to FileRepository folder or Issuing <strong>pnputil.exe /e</strong> command in command prompt.</p><p class="jetpack-slideshow-noscript robots-nocontent">This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p><div id=gallery-1098-16-slideshow class="slideshow-window jetpack-slideshow slideshow-black" data-trans=fade data-autostart=1 data-gallery='[{"src":"https:\/\/kamilpro.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Add-drivers-1.jpg","id":"1114","title":"Add-drivers-1","alt":"","caption":"","itemprop":"image"},{"src":"https:\/\/kamilpro.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Add-drivers-2.jpg","id":"1115","title":"Add-drivers-2","alt":"","caption":"","itemprop":"image"},{"src":"https:\/\/kamilpro.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Add-drivers-3.jpg","id":"1116","title":"Add-drivers-3","alt":"","caption":"","itemprop":"image"},{"src":"https:\/\/kamilpro.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Add-drivers-4.jpg","id":"1117","title":"Add-drivers-4","alt":"","caption":"","itemprop":"image"}]' itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageGallery></div><h3 id=add-drivers-with-command-prompt-8211-pnputil>Add drivers with Command prompt – PNPUTIL<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#add-drivers-with-command-prompt-8211-pnputil>#</a></h3><p>This way is slightly more complicated, nevertheless, let’s have a fun!</p><ol><li>Open elevated command prompt and use change directory to where your drivers are.

While there are some tools/scripts which can deliver the drivers in one way or another (and with the tools there is always a question of how reliable the tool is) having drivers injected to the image will always ensure the hardware is operational straight after deployment.</p><p>The 2 drawbacks of the whole process in the matter are: having a larger image and updating the drivers on the image. While the size and deployment time shouldn’t be a big deal nowadays, keeping up-to-date images is probably your responsibility after all. Not to mention the time saved for troubleshooting as this method works always, 100%, positive.</p><p>Did you enjoy reading the post or found it useful? I’m really keen to know! Let me know below in the comments section.</p><p>I’ve spent hours searching a way/tool capable of fully automatic drivers deployment to the computers of different hardware specs.

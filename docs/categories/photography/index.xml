    <description><![CDATA[Hever Castle &#8211; 31st of AugustThat was an intense weekend. I spent Saturday in shopping centre, buying more and less needed stuff, and today went to Hever Castle.
This over 500 years old castle was once home for Anne Boleyn, 2nd wife of Henry VIII, and as most of the castles these days, it’s a tourist attraction.
There were plenty of attractions prepared for the day including archery, fighting, maze, water maze, castle itself and beautiful Italian garden with the option to rent a boat.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>When I look backwards, I have always been fascinated by a photography for quite a long time. But it really hit me about 4 years ago, when I bought some Panasonic camera with 16x zoom. It was only at that particular time that I thought zoom was the most important feature of a camera. Well, I can now say that it is cool to have zoom, but without vibration reduction you cannot do much on long focal length.</p>]]></description>

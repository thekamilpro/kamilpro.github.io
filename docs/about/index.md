# About

Hi, my name is Kamil Procyszyn and this my blog. Below you can find information about what I’m doing.

# I am an IT professional

For almost 15 years I&#8217;ve been passionate about computer-related technology. My main area of expertise is Microsoft solutions support, with strong focus on automation. 

My professional qualifications include NVQ in Computer Science, and as of 2014, I have become Microsoft Certified Professional. I also hold MCSA for Windows Server. 

You can find more about my career on [LinkedIn][1].

# I have fun&#8230;

&#8230;with blogging. I take it seriously, but still, enjoy sharing my thoughts and ideas with **you**. It’s great when I can publish what I&#8217;ve been thinking about on the website, and let others read it, comment it and maybe reflect on their own lives and relate to my experiences. I read books, watch TV series, listen to good music.

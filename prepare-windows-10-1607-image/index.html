Manual installation, fetching all updates or installing software etc. etc. takes time, and in IT, we really can use that time for something way more productive.\nTherefore, I propose you to create your very own, customised, Windows 10 image which will save you tonnes of time.\nLet’s set some goals:\nAutomatic installation – no questions about user accounts, settings etc. Hardware neutral – image will be installable on any kind of computer with necessary drivers equipped within. Customised – image will be shipped with software and other preferences so that employees will be able to “just” log in straight after deployment. Sounds good? So let’s start preparing.\nPrepare for Windows 10 image creation I know you’d like to just jump in and start creating the new image, but to prepare the image properly there are necessary setup steps needed before the actual process. The benefits of this preparing will come handy in the future.\nWhat you’re going to need is:\nPC capable of virtualisation – Since the image creation will happen in VM (Virtual Machine), we need hardware capable of this. If you’ve got a dedicated machine already – that’s great – if not, then any computer manufactured within the last few years, which can afford at least 2GBs of memory for virtualisation (you can assign less than 2GBs of memory, but everything will be slow. Like really, slow) and hard disk space – only you know how much space you’re going to use for this task. However, bare in mind you should allow extra space for the checkpoints. If you can afford to use SSD that’s great – it hugely improves the speed of the process. Windows 10 ISO file – you’d need this to install the actual image and to create so-called “answer” file out of it. Windows ADK – this will be used for creating the answer file. Hypervisor with checkpoint function – this will allow us to create a VM with the actual image, while checkpoints can save plenty of time in case something goes wrong or must be amended. Software and customisation files which are going to be shipped with Windows. Drivers. Internet – not necessary, but really helpful. As long as you’ve got the hardware capable of virtualisation, the rest comes from the Internet, or your software repositories.\nWindows 10 ISO file The fastest way of getting the Windows 10 ISO file is to go to: https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10ISO or google “Windows Media Creation Tool”. Once on the website, pick “Windows 10” from the drop down menu (unless you’ve got licence for a different version). If your company happens to have a volume licence with Microsoft, then expand “More Download Options” where you can find links to MSDN websites.\nWhen using Media Creation Tool, make sure to pick *.ISO file during the process. The file will be later on used in both, hypervisor and answer file.\nDo not try to obtain images from any other, unofficial sources, as there’s always a chance of getting something “extra” from dishonest people. Nobody likes “extras” in Windows images.\nWindows ADK https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/windows-assessment-deployment-kit\nWindows ADK (Assessment and Deployment Kit) is a set of tools required for image customisation and checking the performance of the computer. You need to fetch the version corresponding to the Windows image creation, as of writing this article, the newest version is Windows 10, version 1607.\nStart the downloaded file, and upon the choice you need only 2 out of all:\nDeployment tools – SIM (Windows System Image Manager) – this tool is used to create the answer file, which will allow for automatic installation of Windows. Windows PE (Preinstallation Environment) – will be used for capturing the image. Unless you’ve got other solution in place (e.g. Norton Ghost) this tool is necessary. Hypervisor The customised image will be created within the VM and therefore hypervisor is essential to it. The second requirement are snapshots, which will allow us to roll back any wrong changes, as well as re-use the image for any amendments/updates required after creating the initial image.\nSnapshot = Checkpoint. These words can be used interchangeably.\nI can only think about 2 free options here – first is Microsoft Hyper-V, which comes built in Windows 8 or 10 in Pro edition, or any Windows Server since 2008 version. If you don’t have a such a possibility, you can use VirtualBox, which is free and has desired checkpoints functionality. Obviously, any hypervisor with checkpoints feature should do the trick.\nI’ll be using Hyper-V since I’ve got Windows 10 Pro in my setup. To install Hyper-V on either Windows client or Server, make sure that Virtualization is enabled in your BIOS/UEFI setting, this is often called Intel VT, AMD-V or simply Virtualization Technology.\nIn order to instal Hyper-V in Windows Clients, go to Control Panel\u003ePrograms and Features\u003eTurn Windows features on or off. Then expand Hyper-V menu and make sure that you can tick Hyper-V Management Tools and Hyper-v Platform. You will need to reboot the PC for the role to become active.\nIn Windows Server, you will need to add Hyper-V role to the server and reboot the server afterwards.\nSoftware It might be any sort of installer or even copy-paste type of application. If it works with the standard Windows installation, it should work with the customised image.\nCustomised files – this will be any specific wallpapers, files etc. which are used to brand the image.\nDrivers Since Windows 10 is shipped with plenty of drivers out of box, there are still many propetiary ones which must be either downloaded via WU (Windows Update) or installed manually. If your environment does not allow/provide drivers download via Windows Update, you must add them to the image.\nI did write a whole blog of how to add any drivers to the image.\nIn other words, you need drivers with *.inf files, some manufacturers allow you to download the whole package of *.inf files for a computer series, some don’t. In such a case, you might need to unpack the drivers manually to get *.inf files out of it.\nPrepare the environment for Windows 10 image I hope you’re still bearing with me to this point, the most boring parts is behind us – I mean gathering all the stuff needed for the image creation.\nLet’s look up the steps to follow:\nCreate VM Install Windows Put set Windows into Audit mode Install software Add drivers Customise Menu Start Creating answer file Testing the image Shall we begin?\nCreate VM + Virtual Switch for VM VM will need a connection to the local network as well as the Internet. Therefore we need to create a virtual switch to which the VM is going to be connected.\nCreating Virtual Switch To create a virtual switch you need to:\nVirtual Switch manager Highlight new virtual switch, pick “External”, and click Create Virtual Switch Give it meaningful name e.g. Internet, make sure that External radius is ticked and choose the network card which used to connect to the Internet, click OK. The network switch is being created. Once your virtual switch has been created, we can start creating the new VM and use the switch to connect VM to the Internet.\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.

Assign at least 2 GBs, if you can 4GBs.

Since this is not an article about shares and permissions I’ll keep it short – Windows differentiates 2 levels of access – local and networked. The user must have access locally to be able to access the files at all and locally, that is, while working on the actual computer. Networked access allows users to access the files over the network, and folders accessed that way are called shares.  In the case of when a user has only network rights, one still won’t be able to access the files because of the lack of the local permission.</p><h2 id=map-the-network-drive>Map the network drive<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#map-the-network-drive>#</a></h2><p>Once the network share has been created, it’s time to map it.

Where’s the file then? You’ve guessed it right, on the Windows 10 ISO, the same which we’ve used to install Windows 10 earlier on.</p><p>Microsoft started using ESD files to include Windows installation files, which are way more compressed than actual WIM files.

I can suggest to create a dedicated folder where you’re going to store all ISOs used for installation and another folder called WIM where you’ll store WIM files.

Instead, I’ll simply paste the answer file here and describe what it does in each phase.</p><p><a href=https://kamilpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Windows_10_pro.xml>Answer file – Windows_10_pro.xml</a> (right click and dowload/save link as)</p><p>Use SIM to open the file above, and point to Windows 10 1607 WIM file.</p><h3 id=phase-1-winpe>Phase 1 WinPE<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#phase-1-winpe>#</a></h3><p>That one happens when you actually boot a computer from the installation media and are presented with the install now screen.</p><p>What happens in “amd64_Microsoft-Windows-International-Core-WinPE” is to choose which display language should be picked.</p><p>The “amd64_Microsoft-Windows-Setup” tells installer to wipe the first hard drive, then create 4 partitions (as needed for UEFI) and to modify them. While first 3 partitions are needed for Windows to run and have a fixed size, the 4th – where the actual OS is – will use all remaining space for itself.</p><h3 id=phase-4-specialize>Phase 4 Specialize<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#phase-4-specialize>#</a></h3><p>That phase happens when Windows is “Getting ready”. You can notice a CopyProfile option – it tells the installer to take Administrator’s profile (the same which you’ve customised earlier on in the Audit mode) and set it as the default profile – so that every profile created on the computer will have the same customisation.</p><p>The product key used here is generic Windows 10 Pro, you should change it to yours. You won’t be able to activate Windows with that key.</p><h3 id=phase-7-oobe>Phase 7 OOBE<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#phase-7-oobe>#</a></h3><p>OOBE – Out of box experience – is the Wizard which you see during the first Windows boot.</p><p>“amd64_Microsoft-Windows-International-Core” will tell the computer which language, region and keyboard layout will be used for the users.</p><p>“amd64_Microsoft-Windows-Shell-Setup” will accept the agreement, set Windows to get automatic Windows Updates and create local user “Dave” who will be an administrator. Notice that password field is hashed, therefore you should change it to yours.</p><h4 id=defaultuser0-bug>Defaultuser0 bug<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#defaultuser0-bug>#</a></h4><p>When at some point you’ll start testing/deploying the image, you might notice a 2nd user account created during the installation, called defaultuser0. It’s being created during the CopyProfile function, I couldn’t find an explanation why it happens.</p><p>We could switch off the CopyProfile, but then it would be necessary to spend a way more time with customising (including start menu, theme, wallpaper etc. would need to be set, configured with text files and exported – which is not really user friendly).</p><p>Or we could keep using CopyProfile and call a command “net user defaultuser0 /delete” during first user logon, which removes it automatically. I prefer the second option, which is included in the answer file.</p><h2 id=save-the-answer-file>Save the answer file<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#save-the-answer-file>#</a></h2><p>Once you’re happy with your answer file, save in the shared folder created earlier on.</p><h1 id=preparing-the-image-for-capturehousekeeping>Preparing the image for capture/housekeeping<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#preparing-the-image-for-capturehousekeeping>#</a></h1><p>We need to do some housekeeping to make the image clean and neat for the end user:</p><ul><li>Run Windows updates</li><li>Run antivirus updates</li><li>Remove all browsing history from Internet browsers</li><li>Unmount all mounted network drives</li><li>Right click on the address bar in Windows explorer and choose “Delete history”</li><li>Run disk clean up</li><li>Make sure there are no passwords saved in the Credential manager (Control panel>Credential Manager)</li><li>Remove any directories used during image preparation (e.g. C:\temp)</li></ul><p class="jetpack-slideshow-noscript robots-nocontent">This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p><div id=gallery-774-10-slideshow class="slideshow-window jetpack-slideshow slideshow-black" data-trans=fade data-autostart=1 data-gallery='[{"src":"https:\/\/kamilpro.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Housekeeping-1.jpg","id":"1014","title":"Housekeeping 1","alt":"","caption":"","itemprop":"image"},{"src":"https:\/\/kamilpro.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Housekeeping-2.jpg","id":"1015","title":"Housekeeping 2","alt":"","caption":"","itemprop":"image"},{"src":"https:\/\/kamilpro.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Housekeeping-3.jpg","id":"1016","title":"Housekeeping 3","alt":"","caption":"","itemprop":"image"},{"src":"https:\/\/kamilpro.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Housekeeping-4.jpg","id":"1017","title":"Housekeeping 4","alt":"","caption":"","itemprop":"image"},{"src":"https:\/\/kamilpro.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Housekeeping-5.jpg","id":"1018","title":"Housekeeping 5","alt":"","caption":"","itemprop":"image"}]' itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageGallery></div><p>In other words – when your users get freshly wiped PC, they’ll get an impression it’s spanking new, yet customised by their great IT department. It makes a difference, a huge difference to the end user.</p><h1 id=test-the-image-within-vm>Test the image within VM<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#test-the-image-within-vm>#</a></h1><p>That’s a great moment, isn’t it? I’m always excited when testing the new image and see how all the work turns out. But before deploying it to the actual physical machine, it’s worth to test it within the actual VM.</p><p>Why? Because due to checkpoints, it’s extremely easy to roll back the deployment, amend the setting and deploy once again. It’s a real time saver. Therefore, do not expect the image to be ready after the first time. My first attempt took about a week to get fully polished and prepared image.</p><h2 id=take-the-checkpoint-now>Take the checkpoint now<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#take-the-checkpoint-now>#</a></h2><p>Remember: if there’s something you don’t like after the deployment or test, you can always roll back, change the image and try once again (and don’t forget to take another checkpoint).</p><p>You can repeat that process until you’re fully satisfied with the result.</p><h2 id=sysprep-8211-the-tool-for-generalization>Sysprep – the tool for generalization<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#sysprep-8211-the-tool-for-generalization>#</a></h2><p>Generalise makes the image truly hardware neutral. It removes all installed drivers, Windows activation, unique installation details for the VM – it then allows computer to install completely fresh and setup itself for the new installation or another computer.</p><p>To generalise Windows installation you’d like to:</p><ol><li>Open elevated command prompt</li><li>Type: <strong>CD C:\Windows\System32\Sysprep</strong></li><li>Type: **SYSPREP /GENERALIZE /OOBE /REBOOT /UNATTEND:<path to your unattended file> **We call sysprep tool to generalise the installation, set Windows into OOBE mode, use answer file and restart the PC.</li><li>Wait until the sysprep process is done and PC restart.</li></ol><p class="jetpack-slideshow-noscript robots-nocontent">This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p><div id=gallery-774-11-slideshow class="slideshow-window jetpack-slideshow slideshow-black" data-trans=fade data-autostart=1 data-gallery='[{"src":"https:\/\/kamilpro.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Sysprep-1.jpg","id":"1020","title":"Sysprep 1","alt":"","caption":"","itemprop":"image"},{"src":"https:\/\/kamilpro.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Sysprep-2.jpg","id":"1021","title":"Sysprep 2","alt":"","caption":"","itemprop":"image"},{"src":"https:\/\/kamilpro.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Sysprep-3.jpg","id":"1022","title":"Sysprep 3","alt":"","caption":"","itemprop":"image"},{"src":"https:\/\/kamilpro.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Sysprep-4.jpg","id":"1023","title":"Sysprep 4","alt":"","caption":"","itemprop":"image"}]' itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageGallery></div><p>Once completed, VM should restart a few times and – if everything goes well – bring you to the login screen. You’d like then to review all your customisation settings, make sure that passwords are not saved etc. Remember that whatever you can see after the first login, will be available to any new user using the computer.</p><h1 id=capturing-and-deploying-the-image>Capturing and deploying the image<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#capturing-and-deploying-the-image>#</a></h1><p>Once your VM is up to the standard it’s time to send it to the actual hardware and see if everything still works + all drivers are working.</p><p>However, it’s beyond this article as there are many tools which can be used. If you’ve got any favourite tools which can get the job done – let me know!</p><h1 id=a-few-tips>A few tips:<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#a-few-tips>#</a></h1><ul><li>Always take the checkpoint before syspreping. Windows has a sysprep counter, and after generalising an image few times it will not allow you to generalise it another! This means you’d need to create another image from the scratch. On the other hand, if you’ve got a VM with checkpoint just before sysprep, you can always come back to it, amend it, checkpoint it and sysprep again, unlimited number of times.</li><li>If there are too many checkpoints (and not enough hard disk space), you can always remove all of them and create a new one.</li><li>Creating the image is a long process – take your time!</li></ul><p>Main photo by: https://unsplash.com/@rawpixel</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://kamilpro.com/tags/1607/>1607</a></li><li><a href=https://kamilpro.com/tags/answer/>answer</a></li><li><a href=https://kamilpro.com/tags/deployment/>deployment</a></li><li><a href=https://kamilpro.com/tags/feat/>feat</a></li><li><a href=https://kamilpro.com/tags/image/>image</a></li><li><a href=https://kamilpro.com/tags/sysprep/>sysprep</a></li><li><a href=https://kamilpro.com/tags/unattend/>unattend</a></li><li><a href=https://kamilpro.com/tags/windows-10/>windows 10</a></li></ul></footer></article></main><footer class=footer><span>Kamil Procyszyn</span>

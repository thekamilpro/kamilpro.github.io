      <description>Everything is an object in PowerShell, and ability to create own object allows for one more way of controlling and handling data.
In this video I&amp;rsquo;ll take you through the steps of creating PSCustomObject, working with its properties to doing more advanced topics - like adding methods and types to the object.

      <description>In the last part of scripting series, we will make the script to be able to query remote machines, e.g. servers.
We will also check how to add parameters to the script (and configure the default value of parameter) so that user will able to pass the parameter name like in a standard PowerShell cmdlet.
Finally, we are going to format the script so that it looks more reliable and make some refactoring so that the logic is simpler.</description>

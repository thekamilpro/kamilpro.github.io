That we should avoid it, select only the best information.
Oh well, I have overloaded myself recently.
I slept 24 hours over the last 2 days! From 8 PM till 8AM. Children don’t sleep that much. My last 2 days had been like: Wake up, shower, work, coffee, home, dinner, coffee, sleep.
Exciting, isn’t it?
For the past 2 days my memory was like ROM – Read Only Memory – mission was to think clearly.</description></item></channel></rss>

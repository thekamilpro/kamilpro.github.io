      <description>When we buy a new phone, manufacturers advertise it always as a super fast with superb colours and a long lasting battery.
Usually it’s true, which we can confirm just after the unboxing ritual when we hold our brand new device in the hands.
It’s shiny, without scratches, with a specific smell, plus it’s really fast and battery lasts very long.
Until… we actually start using the phone, by this I mean installing the whole lot of our favourite apps.</description>

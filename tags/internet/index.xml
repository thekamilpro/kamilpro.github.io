&lt;/div>PowerShell is a great server automation tool, but what about Internet and any other web served services?
As it turns out, PowerShell is great in scrapping websites and consuming APIs – and it’s been one of the main development areas of the tool in the last couple of years.

&lt;/div>Because software was working without the need of downloading tons of patches. Why do we actually need to update software in the first place?
In the past, the only way to obtain a software was by delivering the physical media to the recipient. There was a cost of media itself and shipment (and probably much more of which I’m not aware of), it couldn’t be cheap. While comparing to the current times, it is just a matter of uploading an update to the server and push to users.</description></item><item><title>Share</title><link>https://kamilpro.github.io/share/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jul 2016 22:05:34 +0000</pubDate><author>Kamil</author><guid>https://kamilpro.github.io/share/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

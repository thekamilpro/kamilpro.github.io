&lt;/div>Bump. A new email has just arrived. Have to check it. Now. I might reply to it earlier, but need to read it now.
Seriously, why?
While being on top of every single thing might sound super productive, it’s not. Being busy doesn’t mean that you’re productive. Being busy means you’re busy, got nothing to do with effectiveness.
This is the reason why you’d like to play it smart, and to organise your job into batches.</description></item><item><title>Notification</title><link>https://kamilpro.github.io/notification/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jul 2016 19:48:05 +0000</pubDate><author>Kamil</author><guid>https://kamilpro.github.io/notification/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>I carry with me 2 phones – personal one and work one. On the first one, I store only personal stuff, while on the 0ther one everything what is work related.
I have been using my phones like probably most of the people – putting them on vibration while in the restaurants, office etc. so that the phones wouldn’t annoy people around me. But, something’s changed when I was sent for a business trip abroad.</description></item></channel></rss>

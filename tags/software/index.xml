&lt;/div>Having software consistently deployed across the fleet of computers is one of the key points that can be automated.
If I have a choice (and it makes sense), I will always choose GPO over any other solution because it’s embedded into Active Directory thus not requiring installation, learning and maintenance of additional management tool.
MSI – Software Installation One of the main advantages of MSI installers is that in 99% of cases you can just use the “Software Installation” option in GPO, and GPO will take care of the silent installation.</description></item><item><title>Sysadmin’s tools – what I have installed on my laptop</title><link>https://kamilpro.github.io/sysadmins-tools-what-i-have-installed-on-my-laptop/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jan 2019 20:40:21 +0000</pubDate><author>Kamil</author><guid>https://kamilpro.github.io/sysadmins-tools-what-i-have-installed-on-my-laptop/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>We need tools to make our work. Either it’s notepad and paper, a hammer (for server’s hard reset… just joking) or some sophisticated and bespoke peace of hardware – we as professionals need tools to make our work better, or even possible.

&lt;/div>Because software was working without the need of downloading tons of patches. Why do we actually need to update software in the first place?
In the past, the only way to obtain a software was by delivering the physical media to the recipient.

While comparing to the current times, it is just a matter of uploading an update to the server and push to users.</description></item></channel></rss>

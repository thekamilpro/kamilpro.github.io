      <description>How many times I’ve put my all enthusiasm into something, being convinced that it was the right thing.

How many time afterwards I have realised that my belief was completely wrong. Like 100% wrong. Like back to front feeling.
I think the most difficult is the moment of making a decision. That very moment when it’s time to commit to a long standing decision. The second when it’s time to reveal self and go public.</description>

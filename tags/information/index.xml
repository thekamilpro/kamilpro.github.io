      <description>A friend visited us yesterday. There was a nice cake, coffee, dinner and conversations thoughtout the night.
Suddenly the ladies started to talk about navigation apps on mobile devices. K. was complaining about high data usage during browsing on the Internet. J. suggested her to try Here maps as it is free and allows to download the maps, therefore data is completely not needed for navigation to work, plus it is really accurate app.</description>

      <description>Spam. Spam everywhere. There isn’t a day without it. Without bombarding us with plenty of information. Way too much of information.
While the original – email spam – is well handled by email providers, the other sources are not.
On social media – there is plenty of shared stuff which someone (I hope so!) thought was worth of sharing. News is all over the place – starting from daily free newspapers, through radio and TV and ending up on the Internet.</description>

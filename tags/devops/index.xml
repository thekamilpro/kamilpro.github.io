      <description>The World talks constantly about DevOps, CI/CI pipelines, automation - which great, but where to actually start? Especially when you&amp;rsquo;ve been writing PowerShell which is often used as automation language, but not actually as programming language?
In this video I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to create a build pipeline for PowerShell module, from scratch. We will start from creating a project, creating new Git repository, pushing code to repository to finally create a pipeline which takes care of building the module, versioning it and finally publishing.</description>

      <description>My story on how I turned from Sysadmin to DevOps engineer, with PowerShell driving my journey!
It&amp;rsquo;s crazy to think that 5 years ago I couldn&amp;rsquo;t code, and one tweet simply started a snowball effect on my career.
I wanted to document this moment in my life as I&amp;rsquo;ve passed Azure DevOps engineer exam and been working as DevOps engineer - something I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even about thinking without PowerShell and its great community.</description>

&lt;/div>Deploying a new server is always fun! Well, at least the part after ISO download, installation, patching. Having said that, why not create a template so that you jump right into the fun?
So we are essentially going to create a preconfigured VHDX file that can be attached to the newly created VM, and it will take you straight to the login screen.
What’s needed Windows server or Windows 10 with Hyper-V role and management tools enabled Windows Assessment and Deployment Toolkit (ADK) – I always pick the latest version available, at the moment of writing this – Windows 10, version 1903 – is latest.</description></item><item><title>Use Windows Server as iSCSI target with ESXi</title><link>https://kamilpro.github.io/use-windows-server-as-iscsi-target-with-esxi/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Aug 2018 17:54:47 +0000</pubDate><author>Kamil</author><guid>https://kamilpro.github.io/use-windows-server-as-iscsi-target-with-esxi/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>The task: to move a virtual machine from one ESXi to another. The ESXis are on two completely separate networks. VM size is 5.5 TB, with one file being 5TB.
The problem: VM cannot be started due to maxed out resources. There’s no NAS or any other means of storage where the files could be transferred to. From previous experience, I knew that transfer over SSH or USB would be well too slow, as the task was time critical.</description></item></channel></rss>

&lt;/div>I remember like when I was 10-ish and had been trying to fix my first computer. There was no Internet, there was no one really to ask for advice or share the knowledge with me. It took me days, and at the very end, I found that I didn’t have essential drivers to make my computer really usable. Did I mention that the Internet wasn’t available yet?
I had to figure this out, and it took me ridiculous amount of time to achieve such a basic task like reinstalling an operating system.</description></item></channel></rss>

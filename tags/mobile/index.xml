&lt;/div>When we buy a new phone, manufacturers advertise it always as a super fast with superb colours and a long lasting battery.
Usually it’s true, which we can confirm just after the unboxing ritual when we hold our brand new device in the hands.
It’s shiny, without scratches, with a specific smell, plus it’s really fast and battery lasts very long.
Until… we actually start using the phone, by this I mean installing the whole lot of our favourite apps.</description></item><item><title>Notification</title><link>https://kamilpro.github.io/notification/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jul 2016 19:48:05 +0000</pubDate><author>Kamil</author><guid>https://kamilpro.github.io/notification/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>I carry with me 2 phones – personal one and work one. On the first one, I store only personal stuff, while on the 0ther one everything what is work related.
I have been using my phones like probably most of the people – putting them on vibration while in the restaurants, office etc. so that the phones wouldn’t annoy people around me. But, something’s changed when I was sent for a business trip abroad.</description></item></channel></rss>

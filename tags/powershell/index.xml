When I attended my first PowerShell meetup back in 2017, I had no idea it would lead me to where I am today.
Fast forward to 3rd of March 2023, I was privileged to speak and share my knowledge with other #PowerShell enthusiasts at #PsDayUk conference. I presented the PowerShell based web server and web framework, which enables anyone familiar with the language, to create web applications.</description></item><item><title>PowerShell Error Handling - One error at the time please</title><link>https://kamilpro.github.io/powershell-error-handling/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.github.io/powershell-error-handling/</guid><description>Code fails - whether because of reasons out of our control, or because we didn&amp;rsquo;t consider the situation it might fail. Expired credentials, timeout connections, lack of permissions go genuine software bug - each of these are potential problem which might fall our code over. And if we don&amp;rsquo;t handle the error, our script will simply throw and terminate. It&amp;rsquo;s certainly not desired state.
In this video I&amp;rsquo;ll show you different ways PowerShell can error, how to debug such errors and how to handle them - so that we are in control.</description></item><item><title>Developing a Web Application with PowerShell - Pode, the PowerFul Module</title><link>https://kamilpro.github.io/powershell-powerful-pode-podeweb/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.github.io/powershell-powerful-pode-podeweb/</guid><description>Web Applications are popular, and often require to either knowing some front-end development or using some other products which allow to build some applications. What about PowerShell, can you actually build a web app using only PowerShell language?
Yes, you can write a web app in PowerShell, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to show you how in this video.
It comes down to two PowerShell modules - Pode and Pode.Web - all you need to do is to run Install-Module Pode,Pode.</description></item><item><title>Building PowerShell module on Azure DevOps pipeline - step by step guide</title><link>https://kamilpro.github.io/powershell-module-building-azure-devops/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.github.io/powershell-module-building-azure-devops/</guid><description>The World talks constantly about DevOps, CI/CI pipelines, automation - which great, but where to actually start? Especially when you&amp;rsquo;ve been writing PowerShell which is often used as automation language, but not actually as programming language?
In this video I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to create a build pipeline for PowerShell module, from scratch. We will start from creating a project, creating new Git repository, pushing code to repository to finally create a pipeline which takes care of building the module, versioning it and finally publishing.</description></item><item><title>Building PowerShell Module - how to organise your source files and build with ease</title><link>https://kamilpro.github.io/powershell-module-building/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.github.io/powershell-module-building/</guid><description>Organising all files, scripts and functions required to build a module might give one a headache. PowerShell doesn&amp;rsquo;t come with native way of building the module, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t make our job easier.
Hence, we&amp;rsquo;re going to use ModuleBuilder from PowerShell community so that the way we organise the code is predictable and used widely across other PowerShell projects.
In this video I&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through the process of preparing, organising and finally building the module.</description></item><item><title>PowerShell Module and Manifest- create and configure your tools</title><link>https://kamilpro.github.io/powershell-module-manifest/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.github.io/powershell-module-manifest/</guid><description>The more PowerShell code you write results in more and more scripts. Often you have multiple scripts managing one domain or application. What in situation when scripts start to use other scripts to work, creating so called dependency?
PowerShell module is the answer - it&amp;rsquo;s the native way of bundling in multiple functions together as a single file. And the best comes with Module&amp;rsquo;s Manifest, a file that describes things like version of your module, requirements for it to run, author&amp;rsquo;s details etc.</description></item><item><title>PowerShell Parameter Attributes - validate, group, require params and add pipeline to your function</title><link>https://kamilpro.github.io/powershell-parameter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.github.io/powershell-parameter/</guid><description>Having properly configured parameters help your users to understand the use of your function. It also helps fellow developers to appreciate the intended use of the function. In addition, it gives you more control of how the code flows through your script.
Parameter attributes is what takes parameters to the next level - you can specify that certain parameters are mandatory, group them together so that only certain combination of parameters is meant to work together, we can even add pipeline support so that function can be used as any other built-in function.</description></item><item><title>PowerShell function - converting script into function with parameters</title><link>https://kamilpro.github.io/powershell-function/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.github.io/powershell-function/</guid><description>So you&amp;rsquo;ve been writing your scripts for some time and wondering how to make them more PowerShell-like, so that they can be invoked from the console like all the other cmdlets?

We will also check how to add parameters to the script (and configure the default value of parameter) so that user will able to pass the parameter name like in a standard PowerShell cmdlet.
Finally, we are going to format the script so that it looks more reliable and make some refactoring so that the logic is simpler.</description></item><item><title>PowerShell for IT Professionals [#16] – Scripting part 3 – Add-Member and network</title><link>https://kamilpro.github.io/powershell-for-it-professionals-16-scripting-part-3-add-member-and-network/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Oct 2020 19:12:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.github.io/powershell-for-it-professionals-16-scripting-part-3-add-member-and-network/</guid><description>In this lesson we are taking our script further by adding details about IP configuration and last installed hotfixes.

Then we will retrieve OS information with the help of WMI and display it on the screen with Write-Host.
Although using Write-Host is easy to use, it doesn’t really allow us to do very much e.g. we cannot export information to the CSV, therefore we change it and start using custom PSObject – that way our script will start returning information like a regular PowerShell command.</description></item><item><title>PowerShell for IT Professionals [#14] – Scripting – Hello World!</title><link>https://kamilpro.github.io/powershell-for-it-professionals-14-scripting-hello-world/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Sep 2020 13:00:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.github.io/powershell-for-it-professionals-14-scripting-hello-world/</guid><description>In this lesson we will be preparing our workstation for writing PowerShell scripts.

At the end, we will configure some GPOs to control the execution and transcription of scripts.</description></item><item><title>PowerShell for IT Professionals [#12] – WMI – Windows Management Instrumentation</title><link>https://kamilpro.github.io/powershell-for-it-professionals-12-wmi-windows-management-instrumentation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Sep 2020 16:27:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.github.io/powershell-for-it-professionals-12-wmi-windows-management-instrumentation/</guid><description>In this lesson we learn how to use PowerShell to access WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation), so that we can gain often hidden or obscure information.
We will then use WMI Explorer graphical tool to ease discovering all possible classes and instances that WMI provides.
Finally, we will use WMI queries to add another level of granularity in GPO so that we can target very specific computers in it.
Exercises There’s a WMI class that lists all the installed software – find it and list all currently installed software with PowerShell.</description></item><item><title>PowerShell for IT Professionals [#11] – Variables</title><link>https://kamilpro.github.io/powershell-for-it-professionals-11-variables/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Aug 2020 10:39:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.github.io/powershell-for-it-professionals-11-variables/</guid><description>In this lesson we’re going to learn how what Variables are, why it’s good to use them and how to actually create them. We will then assign various values to variables to and use them solely, and in parameters.
We will also have a look at foreach loop so that we can e.g. ping multiple computers using single variable with multiple objects in it.
Exercises Use Get-Command to find all commands that allow you to manage variables.</description></item><item><title>PowerShell for IT Professionals [#10] – Remote management with PowerShell</title><link>https://kamilpro.github.io/powershell-for-it-professionals-10-remote-management-with-powershell/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Aug 2020 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.github.io/powershell-for-it-professionals-10-remote-management-with-powershell/</guid><description>In this lesson we’re going to learn how to do one-to-one and one-to-many remote management with PowerShell. There’s no need for telnet, ssh or psexec as PowerShell has its own protocol that’s built in right into Windows. We will look at how to create interactive sessions and send commands to multiple servers at once.

Does it behave differently than Export-CSV?
Programs often use CSV but don’t use comma for delimiter – try to exporting to CSV but change the delimiter
Can you print directly from shell?

PowerShell help – Exercises PowerShell is great in working with CSV files. Can you find help for any CSV related commands (you will need to use a wildcard)
Can you tell what’s a difference between ConvertTo-CSV and Export-CSV commands
We often need to review event logs – which command would allow you to retrieve event logs?</description></item><item><title>Restarting VSS Writers with PowerShell script</title><link>https://kamilpro.github.io/restarting-vss-writers-with-powershell-script/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2019 18:27:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.github.io/restarting-vss-writers-with-powershell-script/</guid><description>VSS Writers are responsible for backups – if they stop working, then backups might fail. The solution to that is restarting VSS Writers, but the problem here is that there are many, and at least out of the box, there’s no mechanism to make this automatic… but there’s PowerShell.
I’m not interested in your code, I just want to restart these VSS Writers In that case, head on to: mygithub, use the code and run:</description></item><item><title>Use Windows Server as iSCSI target with ESXi</title><link>https://kamilpro.github.io/use-windows-server-as-iscsi-target-with-esxi/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Aug 2018 17:54:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.github.io/use-windows-server-as-iscsi-target-with-esxi/</guid><description>The task: to move a virtual machine from one ESXi to another. The ESXis are on two completely separate networks. VM size is 5.5 TB, with one file being 5TB.
The problem: VM cannot be started due to maxed out resources. There’s no NAS or any other means of storage where the files could be transferred to. From previous experience, I knew that transfer over SSH or USB would be well too slow, as the task was time critical.</description></item><item><title>Resolve IP and DNS with Powershell tool</title><link>https://kamilpro.github.io/powershell-tool-resolve-ip-and-dns/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Apr 2018 21:40:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.github.io/powershell-tool-resolve-ip-and-dns/</guid><description>I’ve been asked to prepare a simple tool which would:
Resolve IP address or DNS Return all results to table Import addresses from a file The reason behind was to check how IP/DNS records change over the period of time, therefore there was a need for something like that:
A file with all addresses in question Tool which could import all these addresses and resolve them Save the results into a new file Once having at least a couple of files, the results could be compared.</description></item><item><title>Powershell – resolve full names to usernames from CSV file</title><link>https://kamilpro.github.io/powershell-resolve-full-names-usernames-csv-file/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Oct 2017 14:03:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.github.io/powershell-resolve-full-names-usernames-csv-file/</guid><description>It’s unbelievable how long it took me to figure out this simple Powershell script, but yet it does the trick :).
Often you receive a request to do a certain action with a bunch of accounts, and (obviously) the list provided contains the full names rather usernames. Pain to do it manually, but yet we can utilise Powershell here.
What you need: CSV file, with only one column, and the header of the column must be called “Name”, if you prefer to use something different, simply amend Name in line 6 to reflect your header.</description></item></channel></rss>

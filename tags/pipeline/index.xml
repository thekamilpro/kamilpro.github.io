Especially when you&amp;rsquo;ve been writing PowerShell which is often used as automation language, but not actually as programming language?
In this video I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to create a build pipeline for PowerShell module, from scratch. We will start from creating a project, creating new Git repository, pushing code to repository to finally create a pipeline which takes care of building the module, versioning it and finally publishing.</description></item><item><title>PowerShell Parameter Attributes - validate, group, require params and add pipeline to your function</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-parameter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-parameter/</guid><description>Having properly configured parameters help your users to understand the use of your function.

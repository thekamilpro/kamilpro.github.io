      <description>My story on how I turned from Sysadmin to DevOps engineer, with PowerShell driving my journey!
It&amp;rsquo;s crazy to think that 5 years ago I couldn&amp;rsquo;t code, and one tweet simply started a snowball effect on my career.
I wanted to document this moment in my life as I&amp;rsquo;ve passed Azure DevOps engineer exam and been working as DevOps engineer - something I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even about thinking without PowerShell and its great community.</description>

      <description>In this lesson we’re going to learn how what Variables are, why it’s good to use them and how to actually create them. We will then assign various values to variables to and use them solely, and in parameters.
We will also have a look at foreach loop so that we can e.g. ping multiple computers using single variable with multiple objects in it.
Exercises Use Get-Command to find all commands that allow you to manage variables.</description>

      <title>PowerShell for IT Professionals [#10] – Remote management with PowerShell</title>
      <link>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-for-it-professionals-10-remote-management-with-powershell/</link>

      <guid>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-for-it-professionals-10-remote-management-with-powershell/</guid>
      <description>In this lesson we’re going to learn how to do one-to-one and one-to-many remote management with PowerShell. There’s no need for telnet, ssh or psexec as PowerShell has its own protocol that’s built in right into Windows. We will look at how to create interactive sessions and send commands to multiple servers at once.
Exercises Notes Enable-Psremoting Enter-PSSesion ps-svr1 Hostname Get-Service GIP # I can even run commands that are not available on my source machine Get-ADDomainController Get-ADUser Exit or Exit-PSSession # Caution about double hoping Invoke-Command Invoke-Command -computerName ps-svr1 -command { get-service} # Invoke command executes commands on the remote comptuers and brings back the results # Can you tell a difference?</description>

Since working as IT person, there are many software tools I need to do my day to day tasks, thus here’s the list of pieces of software I’ve been finding useful.</description>

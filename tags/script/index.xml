      <description>Code fails - whether because of reasons out of our control, or because we didn&amp;rsquo;t consider the situation it might fail. Expired credentials, timeout connections, lack of permissions go genuine software bug - each of these are potential problem which might fall our code over. And if we don&amp;rsquo;t handle the error, our script will simply throw and terminate. It&amp;rsquo;s certainly not desired state.
In this video I&amp;rsquo;ll show you different ways PowerShell can error, how to debug such errors and how to handle them - so that we are in control.</description>

      <description>So you&amp;rsquo;ve been writing your scripts for some time and wondering how to make them more PowerShell-like, so that they can be invoked from the console like all the other cmdlets?
In this quick video I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to convert a sample script into function, add parameters and indicated to your user how to use your function with mandatory parameters and types.
# Sample script which asks user for basic information, then manipulates it and # display some information # There&amp;#39;s no way (at least easy) to pass these parameters from prompt, nor validate $Name = Read-Host -Prompt &amp;#34;What&amp;#39;s your name?</description>

      <description>Array is a basic data structure that allows to store multiple items in one variable. In this short video, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to create a basic array, populate it with items, how to add, access and modify items within array.
In addition, I&amp;rsquo;ll present to you how to use ArrayList - which is much more flexible array, especially for adding more items.

      <title>PowerShell Switch Statement - Different take on branching</title>

      <description>One switch statement can replace multiple if/else statements, it makes code more readable and is really easy to use - there&amp;rsquo;s no reason why you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t give it a try!

      <title>PowerShell If statement - controlling the flow of your code</title>

      <description>In this video we are exploring how to use If statement in various scenarios. If statement allows you to take tide control over the execution of your code, by dictating your script what to do in a given situation.

      <description>PowerShell is a great server automation tool, but what about Internet and any other web served services?
As it turns out, PowerShell is great in scrapping websites and consuming APIs – and it’s been one of the main development areas of the tool in the last couple of years.
In this lesson we are going to see how to use PowerShell to download files, scrap websites, discover links.
We will then use an API of PasswordPusher (pwpush.</description>

      <title>PowerShell for IT Professionals [#17] – Scripting part 4 – parameters, running remotely and formatting</title>
      <link>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-for-it-professionals-17-scripting-part-4-parameters-running-remotely-and-formatting/</link>

      <description>In the last part of scripting series, we will make the script to be able to query remote machines, e.g. servers.
We will also check how to add parameters to the script (and configure the default value of parameter) so that user will able to pass the parameter name like in a standard PowerShell cmdlet.
Finally, we are going to format the script so that it looks more reliable and make some refactoring so that the logic is simpler.</description>

      <title>PowerShell for IT Professionals [#16] – Scripting part 3 – Add-Member and network</title>
      <link>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-for-it-professionals-16-scripting-part-3-add-member-and-network/</link>

      <description>In this lesson we are taking our script further by adding details about IP configuration and last installed hotfixes.
But it turns out, the networking information is not that shallow as it seems at the first glance – thus I’ll show you how to retrieve the information from the configuration.
We will also look on how to reuse our already created object so that we don’t need to duplicate code.</description>

      <guid>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-for-it-professionals-15-scripting-part-2-if-and-psobject/</guid>
      <description>In this lesson we carry on writing the scripting by gathering requirements and putting them together as comments in code.
Then we will retrieve OS information with the help of WMI and display it on the screen with Write-Host.
Although using Write-Host is easy to use, it doesn’t really allow us to do very much e.g. we cannot export information to the CSV, therefore we change it and start using custom PSObject – that way our script will start returning information like a regular PowerShell command.</description>

      <description>In this lesson we will be preparing our workstation for writing PowerShell scripts. We will start by enabling RSAT and then install Visual Studio Code which is a recommended and free PowerShell code editor.
We will then have a look at the basic function of VS Code and create a simple “Hello World” script.
Exercises If you haven’t followed along, you definitely would like to install VS Code and create a *.</description>

      <title>Powershell – resolve full names to usernames from CSV file</title>
      <link>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-resolve-full-names-usernames-csv-file/</link>

      <guid>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-resolve-full-names-usernames-csv-file/</guid>
      <description>It’s unbelievable how long it took me to figure out this simple Powershell script, but yet it does the trick :).
Often you receive a request to do a certain action with a bunch of accounts, and (obviously) the list provided contains the full names rather usernames. Pain to do it manually, but yet we can utilise Powershell here.
What you need: CSV file, with only one column, and the header of the column must be called “Name”, if you prefer to use something different, simply amend Name in line 6 to reflect your header.</description>

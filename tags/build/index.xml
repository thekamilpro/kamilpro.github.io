Especially when you&amp;rsquo;ve been writing PowerShell which is often used as automation language, but not actually as programming language?
In this video I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to create a build pipeline for PowerShell module, from scratch. We will start from creating a project, creating new Git repository, pushing code to repository to finally create a pipeline which takes care of building the module, versioning it and finally publishing.</description></item><item><title>Building PowerShell Module - how to organise your source files and build with ease</title><link>https://kamilpro.github.io/powershell-module-building/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Kamil</author><guid>https://kamilpro.github.io/powershell-module-building/</guid><description><![CDATA[Organising all files, scripts and functions required to build a module might give one a headache.

In this video I&rsquo;ll walk you through the process of preparing, organising and finally building the module.]]></description></item></channel></rss>

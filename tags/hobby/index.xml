      <description>“I’m going to lose 10 KG”
“I’ll start exercising”
“I’ll crack on with my studies and get a better job”
Can you recall any of these? We prefer to set ourselves goals within certain time frame, like beginning of the year, month or week. That sort of fresh-start gets extra power as a statement, allows us to easily cut off the imperfect past from the all new and wonderful future.</description>

      <description>Sometimes I am so deep in my thoughts that I have no notion of what time of the day is. I know I should be doing something, anything but wasting my time… Life is too short to waste time but all the possibilities somehow don’t even cross my mind.
Do you get the same feeling where you can literally stare at the wall opposite while the time stands still? It’s a horrible feeling.</description>

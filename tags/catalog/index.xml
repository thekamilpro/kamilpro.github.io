      <description>Recently I’ve had a request to restore a certain backup from the old backup tapes. We’ve had a new Backup exec installation which didn’t have the catalogue/record of these tapes nor the actual tape drive to recover them – I knew it was going to be one in the world task. And the hell it was.
Locating tapes in the storage unit was a pure joy – no need to go to the gym after this.</description>

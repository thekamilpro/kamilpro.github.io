      <description>Congratulations! This is 20th and last lesson in the course – and my aim here is to show you various paths you can take your PowerShell journey to.
I’m going to show what else you can do within PowerShell itself, as well how to keep up-to-day plus – what other doors writing code has opened for you – I’d love to hear back about this!
I hope you’ve enjoyed the course so far and it will be helped you in some way – either solve a problem, got promotion, or simply learnt something new.</description>

      <description>PowerShell is a great server automation tool, but what about Internet and any other web served services?
As it turns out, PowerShell is great in scrapping websites and consuming APIs – and it’s been one of the main development areas of the tool in the last couple of years.
In this lesson we are going to see how to use PowerShell to download files, scrap websites, discover links.
We will then use an API of PasswordPusher (pwpush.</description>

      <description>Although PowerShell treats everything as object - including text strings - working with text might be particularly difficult - at least when first approached.
In this lesson we are going to have a closer look at what is possible with built in text methods and see how these can help us e.g. by extracting a substring of text.
PowerShell can also be great at parsing log files - we will use Select-String to quickly filter out the lines of text with the phrase we are looking for e.</description>

      <description>In this lesson we will be preparing our workstation for writing PowerShell scripts. We will start by enabling RSAT and then install Visual Studio Code which is a recommended and free PowerShell code editor.
We will then have a look at the basic function of VS Code and create a simple “Hello World” script.
Exercises If you haven’t followed along, you definitely would like to install VS Code and create a *.</description>

      <title>PowerShell for IT Professionals [#13] – Is PowerShell secure?</title>
      <link>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-for-it-professionals-13-is-powershell-secure/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 12 Sep 2020 16:09:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-for-it-professionals-13-is-powershell-secure/</guid>
      <description>In this lesson we will have a look on PowerShell built in security features and how it differs from e.g. BAT files.
We will then have a look how execution policy can help to control on what basis the PowerShell scripts can be executed.
At the end, we will configure some GPOs to control the execution and transcription of scripts.</description>

      <title>PowerShell for IT Professionals [#12] – WMI – Windows Management Instrumentation</title>
      <link>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-for-it-professionals-12-wmi-windows-management-instrumentation/</link>

      <guid>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-for-it-professionals-12-wmi-windows-management-instrumentation/</guid>
      <description>In this lesson we learn how to use PowerShell to access WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation), so that we can gain often hidden or obscure information.
We will then use WMI Explorer graphical tool to ease discovering all possible classes and instances that WMI provides.
Finally, we will use WMI queries to add another level of granularity in GPO so that we can target very specific computers in it.
Exercises There’s a WMI class that lists all the installed software – find it and list all currently installed software with PowerShell.</description>

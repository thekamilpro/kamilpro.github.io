      <description>I Stopped drinking coffee three months ago.
The worst was the first week, which I can compare to having a hangover, but without the sensitivity to light and feeling dehydrated. For a week, I suffered from headaches, nausea, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating.
There were times of the day, like 9 in the morning, when I needed my cup of coffee to stop my body from screaming for it and to get that energy boost.</description>

      <description>They say that habits are our second nature. Things which we do repeatedly are like pre-programmed functions which trigger specific time or action.
Morning coffee. I simply cannot start the day without a cup of a real coffee. That was the reason why I bought the actual bean to coffee machine, because of the taste and smell of real coffee. Prepared in the exact way I like it.
This week I’ve ran out of the time in the morning and couldn’t make my favourite coffee, so I used the instant one.</description>

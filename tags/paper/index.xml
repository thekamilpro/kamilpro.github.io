      <description>Iâ€™ve got a good memory. I can remember different things quite easily, organise and plan them in my mind. A serious and complex task is not a big deal to me, as long as I can understand it. At times I can be annoying (I guess some might say that), by asking many questions, as understanding of each step is a baseline to completing every task correctly.
But there is something magical in writing down the tasks.</description>

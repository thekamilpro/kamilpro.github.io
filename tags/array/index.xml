      <description>Array is a basic data structure that allows to store multiple items in one variable. In this short video, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to create a basic array, populate it with items, how to add, access and modify items within array.
In addition, I&amp;rsquo;ll present to you how to use ArrayList - which is much more flexible array, especially for adding more items.

      <description>In this lesson we’re going to learn how what Variables are, why it’s good to use them and how to actually create them. We will then assign various values to variables to and use them solely, and in parameters.
We will also have a look at foreach loop so that we can e.g. ping multiple computers using single variable with multiple objects in it.
Exercises Use Get-Command to find all commands that allow you to manage variables.</description>

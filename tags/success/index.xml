      <description>Iâ€™ve just passed 1000 subscribers on my #YouTube channel - thank you! https://lnkd.in/e6mBpUZA

I wanted to create a community where people could come to learn more about #powershell and how to become modern #sysadmin, while being free to ask any questions on the topic!</description>

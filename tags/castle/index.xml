I spent Saturday in shopping centre, buying more and less needed stuff, and today went to Hever Castle.
This over 500 years old castle was once home for Anne Boleyn, 2nd wife of Henry VIII, and as most of the castles these days, it’s a tourist attraction.
There were plenty of attractions prepared for the day including archery, fighting, maze, water maze, castle itself and beautiful Italian garden with the option to rent a boat.</description></item></channel></rss>

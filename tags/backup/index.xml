I’m not interested in your code, I just want to restart these VSS Writers In that case, head on to: mygithub, use the code and run:</description></item><item><title>The automation process stages</title><link>https://kamilpro.github.io/the-automation-process-stages/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2019 07:50:11 +0000</pubDate><author>Kamil</author><guid>https://kamilpro.github.io/the-automation-process-stages/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

What does it mean to automate? Simply put, is to remove a person from equation in order to complete the task. It can go as far as automating the whole process, or just part of it.

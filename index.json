Fast forward to 3rd of March 2023, I was privileged to speak and share my knowledge with other #PowerShell enthusiasts at #PsDayUk conference. I presented the PowerShell based web server and web framework, which enables anyone familiar with the language, to create web applications. There were questions, there were raised hands, there was a conversation between me and other attendees - I hope everyone left with a wonderful experience. Looking back and thinking that a few years ago I knew nothing about PowerShell, let alone writing code is just mind blowing. I would like to thank everyone who came to my presentation, and everyone who has been with me on the journey. It’s the support and encouragement of the community that keeps me motivated!

I wanted to share my knowledge and experience with like-minded IT professionals. I wanted to create a community where people could come to learn more about #powershell and how to become modern #sysadmin, while being free to ask any questions on the topic! Yet I didn’t want to write something for sake of writing something. So I decided to record series of coding videos for absolute beginners - so that hopefully I would help and convert more users into PowerShell. And although I used to write a blog, I have switched to a videoblog. Video gave me more possibilities to express myself, and allowed viewers to follow and see exactly what’s was going on my screen and what results I get - something I find invaluable while learning and practicing anything. In the course of working on new videos, I’ve learnt some basics of video editing - if you compare the very first video to one of the recent… I mean the first video was recorded live, without any post editing - just me talking to the microphone and recording screen, I hope you can see and hear the progress. And even though I’ve been recording videos for over two years, I’ve only started talking openly about it recently. I’m not pushing it in any way - if the conversation we’re having is about a topic I happen to have a video about, I might drop you a link. Perhaps, now it’s time to learn bit more about online marketing ;). Anyways, I’m glad my persistence paid off and the numbers of subscribers is growing steadily.

If I have a choice (and it makes sense), I will always choose GPO over any other solution because it’s embedded into Active Directory thus not requiring installation, learning and maintenance of additional management tool. MSI – Software Installation One of the main advantages of MSI installers is that in 99% of cases you can just use the “Software Installation” option in GPO, and GPO will take care of the silent installation. In addition, if the newer version of the installer is ever listed, you can simply link the newer version of the installer, and GPO will take care of upgrading current installations. The rule is, if the installer doesn’t have any mandatory custom made parameters, it will silently push the software.

The easiest way to achieve this is to use NETLOGON folder. You access it via \\«DomainNAme»\\NETLOGON If you’re not sure what your domain name is, simply open Group Policy manager and it will be listed there: So I’m going to copy the installer file to my NETLOGON folder: \\company.pri\\NETLOGON And create a new GPO: To create a GPO for the installer: After opening the Group Policy Management, right-click on the root/or OU and choose to create a new GPO and link it. Give it an appropriate name and then expand settings: Computer \u003e Policies \u003e Software Settings \u003e Software Installation. Then right-click \u003e New \u003e Package. Point it to your installer file – critical is you must point via network share; thus either \\DomainName\\someshare or \\ComputerName\\share Choose assign and job done. EXE and Non-standard MSI files Sometimes the software installer requires providing custom switches, and the only way to achieve the installation is to use a custom script. Thankfully in GPO, we have an option of startup/shutdown scripts – that the script will execute every time the computers boots/shuts down. On the side note, I’ll add that you can schedule a task via GPO that will kick in the script on a regular basis, or every boot – in case you’d need that. I had once a need to deploy the management client that tended to stop its services with no apparent reason, making management of computers that were out in the field a daunting task. Got it solved by having the installer and script copied to the local machine and a scheduled task that was executing script once per hour. The problem of unmanaged computers has gone. The problem with that kind of installers is the fact they often don’t advertise what switches are required, making it much more difficult. Thus at this stage, you might be forced to either check the developer’s website/manual or even contact them if the silent installation is supported. You can also have a look in the section of tips below which might point you to the solution. Let’s take as an example the installer for Airtame – it’s MSI based, however, requires special switches for silent installation. Likely enough, the software vendor has provided the manual and switches required: https://help.airtame.com/en/articles/2543555-how-to-deploy-the-airtame-app-via-msi The fastest way to validate the script, without writing the script, is to run in the shell. You can open the shell by pressing and holding SHIFT key, then right-click in the windows and choose “Open Windows shell here” msiexec /i \"airtame-application-3.5.1-setup.msi\" /quiet WRAPPED_ARGUMENTS=\"/autostart=false /streaming_notification=true\" Once I’ve validated it’s been installed, time to create a script.

Save the file.

As far as VSS Writers go, there were a few issues needed to be addressed for the function: the VssAdmin.exe tool is CMD only, and returns only strings. There’s no filter in VssAdmin, thus it always returns all writers The writers are associated with many Windows Services, and it’s not always obvious which service is responsible for given VSS Writer Therefore I’ve written a couple of functions: Get-KPVssWriter – that function will convert the output string from VssAdmin into a PowerShell objects + it can filter results by state (at the moment Stable or Failed). Restart-KPVssWriter – this function takes the name of the VSS writer and restarts required service with it. It has hard-coded names of VSS writers with associated services.

The Select-String really shines here as: -Pattern parameter allows it to search for a specific phrase. In that case I’m looking for ‘Writer name:’ as each listed writer starts with that line. -Context 0,4 tells PowerShell that for each pattern (line) you found, match 0 line prior to it, and 4 past it. Thus if we look for this sample: Writer name: 'SqlServerWriter' Writer Id: {a65faa63-5ea8-4ebc-9dbd-a0c4db26912a} Writer Instance Id: {9a2c071c-f231-4a9d-abb3-0b15e1866b79} State: [1] Stable Last error: No error Writer name: 'ASR Writer' Writer Id: {be000cbe-11fe-4426-9c58-531aa6355fc4} Writer Instance Id: {1dcb9866-6b86-4a5f-8dcc-eaf270bbfb2b} State: [1] Stable Last error: No error Writer name: 'MSSearch Service Writer' Writer Id: {cd3f2362-8bef-46c7-9181-d62844cdc0b2} Writer Instance Id: {b4a2be5b-71d4-4579-871c-94b725607c33} State: [1] Stable Last error: No error You can see that there’s pattern: Each Writer Name is followed by four line of text, and then the next one appears. Select-String will then create an object for each pattern found, with properties of Line, Context.PostContext and Context.PreContext. And since we know that: Line = pattern found, Context.PostContext = an array of each line found past pattern Context.PreContext. = an array of each line found prior the pattern It’s very easy to create the object, but first we need to remove the leftovers of the string. Replace ForEach-Object { #Removing clutter Write-Verbose \"Removing clutter \" $Name = $_.Line -replace \"^(.*?): \" -replace \"'\" $Id = $_.Context.PostContext -replace \"^(.*?): \" $InstanceId = $_.Context.PostContext -replace \"^(.*?): \" $State = $_.Context.PostContext -replace \"^(.*?): \" $LastError = $_.Context.PostContext -replace \"^(.*?): \" For every object generated by Select-String, I will assign a specific variable, and run -replace to remove unnecessary characters. Replace can also take regex , making it super effective while working with text. PsCustomObject The final step is to assembly all variables created in previous step into a PowerShell object: foreach ($Prop in $_) { $Obj = [pscustomobject]@{ Name = $Name Id = $Id InstanceId = $InstanceId State = $State LastError = $LastError } }#foreach Since the main purpose of using this function is to restart failed, I thought it would be worth to add a parameter for filtering out VSS Writers based on status, thus this simple if statement which amends what will be outputed by the function: If ($PSBoundParameters.ContainsKey('Status')) { Write-Verbose \"Filtering out the results\" $Obj | Where-Object { $_.State -like \"*$Status\" } } #if else { $Obj } #else There we go, the analogue application has been converted into a digital form (LOL), we can go ahead now and work on the actual restarts.

Set of steps which will lead to an accomplishment of the task. The process might be either verbal – that is people pass the knowledge to each other – or written – that is there’s a document/diagram listing step by step what must be done. Let’s take the backup checks (and if you don’t do backups at the moment, please read this) as an example. Imagine that you have a bunch of clients for whom you perform daily backups, and check the result every day, creating a service desk ticket per each failed backup. The way the task is performed is fairly straightforward – you open a predefined spreadsheet which lists all the computers being backed up, login to the application which is performing backups, and look at the reports, looking for failed and /or missed backups. While identifying these, you then create a ticket for each of the findings and record the ticket number with the state of the backup against the computer. Depending on the fleet of computers and the actual success of the backups, you might end up with various amounts of possible tickets to be created. When everything else has failed, backups become the last resort – they are invaluable. The problem with backups is that their value is often overseen, as they are taken for granted – like a water in the tap. Customers will suddenly ask for the backup if the data is gone. Personally, I couldn’t imagine being caught “red handed” when failed to report a broken backup, when customer asks for a data to be restored. I can identify a few issues between the critical nature and repetitiveness of the work: The same task is performed daily, over and over The person performing checks might not really see a reward or value since backups don’t provide value until recovery is needed. This state can go for months, if not years. It’s possible to overlook an issue There’s nobody shouting about broken backups, thus priority might be given to other incoming work.

It debuted with Server 2012, and allows to add Windows-based server to it, and have a very quick information about them. Once you’ve added your servers there, it will break them down by server roles, so if you’d like quickly find your AD DS servers, just click dedicated tab of them. Need to quikcly check DHCP reservation? Just right click on DHCP server and bring up DHCP console. Another great feautre is having a minal monitoring – you can specify CPU and memory treshold, and as soon as the server hit’s the limit – you’ll know it. It will also record the occurence, so that you can double click on it, and have a snapshot of what processes were crancking your server. I might be wrong here – but seems like that software is not in development anymore (at least I didn’t see any more new features, and didn’t fix old bugs), which is a shame.

It’s hard to put this in formalised matter, or any sort of figure – but the change of my mindset is the biggest one. Simply put – from somebody who never coded before, and didn’t see using code in my life at all, I’ve started automating my tasks by actually writing PowerShell code. And that has opened a whole new world of possibilities. I’m not sure where it’s going to take me, but I’m sure code will become majort part of my career. If I would met a new aspiring sysadmin, I would strongly encourage him or her to start learning programming/scripting language early in career. And everything thanks to Jeffrey Snover and Steven Murawski – who both came to London back in October 2017, thank you for inspiring me! Passed 70-411 exam – I’ve passed the second out of three exams required to achieve MCSA in Windows Server 2012. It was more difficult than the first one, and the third one… is even more difficult. But I’m getting there, consequently. Started mentoring junior staff – it didn’t really come officialy, or was designed, but somehow it just happened. Pretty much both of our junior staff has been replaced by the new members of staff, and since I’m working close with, thus I’ve started teaching them “the sysadmin” way. Therefore it started from basic first line problems, throuh troubleshooting (it’s a skill!) to being simply more independent and open to more challenges. I like it. On the side note, I’ve created two PowerShell converts – we got from the “you never going to have a need of using here” to “hey can you help me to add users to the group with the shell pleas?”.

It’s not really necessary, but gives more control over function. #Create props IF ($addrs -as [ipaddress]) { $props = @{ 'IP' = $resolve.Name 'DNS' = $resolve.NameHost } } ELSE { $props = @{ 'IP' = $resolve.IPAddress 'DNS' = $resolve.Name } }#IF Now, the script prepares properties for the new custom object. Since Powershell uses different property names for different queries, it’s essential to expand the right ones. As you can see above, for the IP address the IP and DNS properties are called Name and NameHost respectively, while for DNS they’re called IPAddress and Name, respectively. By creating properties that way, I’m able to create an object with two consistent collums: IP and DNS which you can see bellow: $obj = New-Object -TypeName psobject -Property $props Write-Output $obj This is it, Powershell will output the nicely formated data onto your screen now: IP DNS -- --- 1.1.1.1.in-addr.arpa 1dot1dot1dot1.cloudflare-dns.com 151.101.0.8","date":"2018-04-29","objectID":"/powershell-tool-resolve-ip-and-dns/:0:0","tags":["dns","feat","ip","network","powershell","resolve","toolmaking"],"title":"Resolve IP and DNS with Powershell tool","uri":"/powershell-tool-resolve-ip-and-dns/"},{"categories":["IT","Windows"],"content":"The reason I manage hundreds of workstations working on various Windows versions.

I hope it will inspire you to do something with your body, mind and people around you. Yes, because once you’ll start feeling better, others around you will start feeling better as well. Just a little over 6 months ago… That was November – rainy, windy and cold November. I was exhausted after months of pushing forward the work load. Our team was going through fundamental changes, and the last months towards November were nerve wracking, and there was no light at the end of the tunnel. At least, not at this very time. I am a productive person, yet despite giving the best and most out of myself, it simply wasn’t enough. Even doing what I like and enjoying it can deplete all sources of energy when it’s too intense. Well, it hit me that very autumn. By that I mean sometimes 12 hours of sleep wasn’t enough to get rested, despite normally I don’t need more than 7. I hated the feeling when my focus reinforced by multiple mugs of coffee simply wasn’t enough. Do you know that feeling when you can do all what you can and by the end of the day, you couldn’t accomplish the goals, yet your brain tells you that the following day is going to be the same? I believe I would have left the job if it wasn’t something I wouldn’t seriously love. I could keep doing the same and hope for either different results (which is madness) or wait till it would end. My decision was to try something different, which after months became something much more than I expected. When there’s no clue, talk to a friend I discussed that with my Father, as I simply couldn’t stand my insufficient energy. He said something like “You have to break this through, go and exercise” and so I did. Like never before. Yes, before all that I was that guy who works in IT department and doesn’t really move much; I didn’t see it as the issue. I needed to do something away from the cubicle as I was spending most of the time either in the office or at home, so running seemed like a perfect choice. One evening I put on my old track suit and old sneakers and went out for like a half an hour. It was dark and cold. I wasn’t actually running at the time, it was some kind of quick walk/slow jogging. Yet it exhausted me physically, I came back home all sweaty – like a horse after the western. From later perspective, I wasn’t that much surprised of the “results”, as for the person who didn’t exercise for over a decade, it was quite a challenge. I believe I can RUN! The following day I felt different – less tired, more positive, happier – just because. That must have been the running day before. And it’s been getting better ever since. Soon afterwards I’ve started using an app on my mobile phone with preset programmes for running. It was a great idea as this app has been monitoring my progress since then, prompting to stay at the right pace, plus it’s been monitoring my every single exercise. Have you ever played RPG games? I spent years playing them, despite the plot I was always excited about the character I played – seeing how it was evolving and getting better with every level. I could now translate the same into my running – monitoring my distance, speed, heart rate etc. over the time. It’s so cool. I can literally challenge myself. So has the energy been the only benefit of running? Absolutely not! During one run I burn (according to the app) approx 700kcal, so I’ve lost weight. 8 Kg by now. While I didn’t complain about my body, I enjoy it now more. I just look better. By having more energy, I could actually do more after work. I started blogging on regular basis now (that’s why if you’ve been following me lately you can notice 2 areas I’ve been writing about – IT/Deployment and Motivation/Productivity). I don’t blog as much as I intend to, but… 1 \u003e 0, if you know what I mean. And I’ve passed 1st out of 3 Server 2012 exams, a month ago.

It might be possible to have a cross Windows version drivers, but you’d need to test it thoroughly. I’ve seen many misbehaving computers just because of wrong drivers used with them.

Your image has just got better! Deploying drivers had always been a mission before I’ve figured out the way I had shown you above. While there are some tools/scripts which can deliver the drivers in one way or another (and with the tools there is always a question of how reliable the tool is) having drivers injected to the image will always ensure the hardware is operational straight after deployment. The 2 drawbacks of the whole process in the matter are: having a larger image and updating the drivers on the image. While the size and deployment time shouldn’t be a big deal nowadays, keeping up-to-date images is probably your responsibility after all. Not to mention the time saved for troubleshooting as this method works always, 100%, positive. Did you enjoy reading the post or found it useful? I’m really keen to know! Let me know below in the comments section. I’ve spent hours searching a way/tool capable of fully automatic drivers deployment to the computers of different hardware specs. I ended it up analysing and figuring out all this myself. Tips If you can’t get the installation files of drivers, but you’ve got already a system where this hardware works, you can export by: open device manager identify the device you’d need the drivers for. Double click on it, choose Details tab and choose “inf name” from property drop down menu, note down the OemXX.inf file name. Create a folder, e.g. C:\\Temp. Then open elevated command prompt and type **pnputil /export-driver OemXX.inf C:\\Temp **You can copy exported file to the missing computer and install them like we did before. If you’ve added the wrong driver, use PNPUTIL /delete-driver OemXX.inf /force to remove it from the driver store. If after the installations of the drivers you cannot find some folders in the installation files (e.g. basicrender.inf) then don’t worry – these files might be default for Windows and system might use the while installing new drivers. Someone can say, that you could use PNPUTIL to add all files *.INF to the driver store, but by the time when the actual process ends, you’ll notice that your driver store folder has swelled multiple times (in my case, that was 10GB after adding all *.INF files from GeForce folder!), containing many drivers which you actually don’t need.

A new email has just arrived. Have to check it. Now. I might reply to it earlier, but need to read it now. Seriously, why? While being on top of every single thing might sound super productive, it’s not. Being busy doesn’t mean that you’re productive. Being busy means you’re busy, got nothing to do with effectiveness. This is the reason why you’d like to play it smart, and to organise your job into batches. Why batching your job is cool To get the idea of batching we need to see how it is usually done. I’ll use the email as the example, but it can really apply to anything what we do on regular basis. Now, honestly, answer to yourself how many times a day: You check email. On your phone, computer, laptop, tablet. You come back to email once read, to reply/delete/archive it How long does it take you each time More than couple of times a day, isn’t it? Probably more than a couple of minutes each time, isn’t it? Now simply do the maths, and see how long it takes you. Even if it’s 20 minutes a day, that’s 140 minutes a week! Even if you can recover only half of this time by a method I’ll shortly show you, that would be still more than 1 hour of your life weekly. Extra 52 hours a year, and we are only talking about emails. Small numbers are impressive when they are actually accumulated, eh?. How can you batch your tasks? I know it might sound crazy (especially when you are in customer handling job) but… check your emails on regular times. It might be twice a day, or every other hour. The main idea is to check the email when actually you’d like to, rather than when the sender wants you to. This benefits you in a few ways: You have a better planning ability, knowing that you’re not hooked up constantly to the email. You won’t get distracted by checking each email coming to your inbox. By not jumping instantly on your email, others might start respecting your time more. While checking the email, say, every other hour everything will accumulate and wait for you. It shouldn’t take too long to quickly go through emails which are junk and get rid of them. Now the goal is pretty simple – action all emails so that you won’t need to come back to them. Reply, archive, delete, ignore – do whatever it takes to go through your inbox. And if there is something that you really cannot act straight away – mark/flash/categorise it so it will stand out of other emails and be easily searchable. Work in this pattern for at least few days to get the idea of any time improvement. How come this method works? You don’t get distracted for one – and we all know how bad it is when we’d need to focus and/or prioritise one task and are constantly distracted by something. This is a big win. You don’t need to waste time to open and close the email application and the actual email. I know, it might be as short as 10 seconds, but multiply 10 second by 30 emails and it’s simply time wasted. It’s like buying a coffee every morning in the coffee shop. £3 pounds isn’t much, but if we do quick maths: £3 * 5 times a week * 4 weeks = £60. This is a dinner for 2, rather than a morning coffee in rush. Some tips about batching: If you’re afraid of applying this method, simply talk to your manager. Explain that you want to be more focused and productive, and this way will not destroy your business. You can agree to trial this method for a couple of weeks. If you’re using the email application which you cannot turn off, use function to “Work offline”, so that new emails will not come to your inbox. If you’re worried about upsetting your sender, you can set out of office message stating that you check your email at certain times and if your attention is needed immediately to call your mobile/landline. You can extend batching beyond the email While email is great example, here are some ideas how to regain even more time: Reading news on many websites – rather than checking all of them, you can sign up for some news aggregator e.g. feedly which will collect all the news from ","date":"2017-05-16","objectID":"/start-batching-your-tasks/:0:0","tags":["batching","notification","time saving"],"title":"Do you check email every 2 minutes?

Appropriate drivers can make a huge difference between computer’s performance, stability and even temperature. Therefore it’s super important to make sure you’ve got up-to-date files included with your image or Windows installation. We are going to review PNPUTIL tool – the versatile tool for handling drivers within the Windows. Why do you need PNPUTIL? Yes, why bother with some command line tool (PNPUTIL is command line only) when there are dedicated installers and device manager? Not to mention that Windows update can download pretty much every single driver missing from the Internet. Well, it’s not that wonderful when there is a need to prepare a couple of dozens of computers. While all sort of installers need hardware to be present during the installation, PNPUTIL doesn’t. In fact, as long as you can provide driver files – *.inf to be more specific – you can add them to the image, and Windows will use them when it has detected the hardware. That allows you to supply drivers before installing Windows on the target computer, which saves time after deployment. Drivers will be therefore installed automatically during Windows installation – fully automatically. What is the Driver Store Windows needs to store all the drivers in one location. Whenever you add, install, update or remove drivers, the OS will use the Driver Store as well as Windows Update to make your devices work properly. Take any driver, and you’ll find (among other files) at least one *.inf file. Windows will use the file to install the driver, using reference in the file to make sure that everything has been installed properly. Another important task of adding new drivers to the driver store is security check of the file, making sure that the driver hasn’t been changed since developer released it. You can find driver store in: C:\\Windows\\System32\\DriverStore. Adding vs Installing While these words are usually used interchangeably, they have a different meaning in Microsoft terminology. Adding means copying the driver and associated with it files to the Driver Store. During that process, all files will be checked for integrity and security. Adding the driver will not make your device working straight away, Windows will need to install it. Installing means using the added driver for the actual hardware. Whenever computer detects a new hardware connected, it will go through the Driver Store/Windows Update and set up the device, provided there is a matching driver available. You can think about it like having spices in your kitchen. When you go to shops you buy pepper, salt, sage, paprika and rosemary. This can be compared to downloading the drivers. Then you unpack these spices and put them in your cupboard. This is adding drivers to the store. Finally, you cook chicken and realise the salt, pepper and paprika will be necessary for it, so you take these spices out of the cupboard and season your chicken. This is installing the drivers. I’m getting hungry now, so let’s better move on to the next step. PNPUTIL syntax There are only 4 main syntaxes in PNPUTIL, which allow you to add, remove, export and list all the drivers currently in the driver store. When you’ll open the command prompt, type PNPUTIL and see: /add-driver \u003cfilename.inf | *.inf\u003e [/subdirs] [/install] Add driver package(s) into the driver store. /subdirs - traverse sub directories for driver packages. /install - install/update drivers on any matching devices. /delete-driver \u003coem#.inf\u003e [/force] Delete driver package from the driver store. /force - delete driver package even when it is in use by devices. /export-driver \u003coem#.inf | *\u003e \u003ctarget directory\u003e Export driver package(s) from the driver store into a target directory. /enum-drivers Enumerate all 3rd party driver packages in the driver store.

We prefer to set ourselves goals within certain time frame, like beginning of the year, month or week. That sort of fresh-start gets extra power as a statement, allows us to easily cut off the imperfect past from the all new and wonderful future. The better I. Me version 1.5. Promises, promises, promises. When would you like to squeeze it in? Despite who and where you are, there is one resource we all have in common. Time. We all have 24 hours a day and it’s up to us how we spend it. I believe that you’ve got your routine set during a day and much of this time will be occupied by things like commuting, working, cooking etc. That takes significant, if not a major part of the day – by this I mean your time and energy. So, when would you like to squeeze in that new promise, provided you don’t know how long and if you’d really like to do that. Anytime you pick, it will probably affect your daily rituals anyway. You’ll then need to spend extra time and energy, which your body system might not be really happy about. Therefore, at the very beginning of something new, you’ll be off the track, with less energy and probably more stressed than you should be. I believe that starting a new experience should be straightforward as possible, which leads me to the next point: Why not start a new hobby on the next day off That will allow you to choose from 24 hours the perfect time to kick off the new hobby. Rather than forcing yourself to do it before/after your normal routine. How does it sound now, 24 hours available to choose from, rather than only few, probably a rush, eh? You are the one who knows your body and mind best, therefore can easily tell when you’re most productive – use it to your advantage. It’s entirely up to you how your new experience going to be, so why not make it the best possible? Oh yes, don’t forget to get rid of distractions, like mobile phone notifications and all sort of social media or TV time wasters. Try to focus as much as possible on your new task. And don’t rush. It will put unnecessary stress and prevent you from concentrating fully. If you need to be somewhere, simply set an alarm 15 minutes before you need to go – 15 minutes will allow you to wrap it up nicely. What if I tried and liked it? Firstly you’d know how it tastes, whether you’d like to carry on or maybe drop it. You should have an idea how the new hobby affects you and how long you’d need to accomplish it. As you know what to expect, it’s much easier to plan and this time for the difference, implement it during your normal routine. I’ve been trying new things doing that way for a few years now, but many turned out to be a flash in the pan, nevertheless, I still carry on with doing some of them – like running. Rather than keep postponing your ideas, blaming yourself for lack of time or courage – simply try them when you’re off next time. Things don’t matter, until executed.

Manual installation, fetching all updates or installing software etc. etc. takes time, and in IT, we really can use that time for something way more productive. Therefore, I propose you to create your very own, customised, Windows 10 image which will save you tonnes of time. Let’s set some goals: Automatic installation – no questions about user accounts, settings etc. Hardware neutral – image will be installable on any kind of computer with necessary drivers equipped within. Customised – image will be shipped with software and other preferences so that employees will be able to “just” log in straight after deployment. Sounds good? So let’s start preparing. Prepare for Windows 10 image creation I know you’d like to just jump in and start creating the new image, but to prepare the image properly there are necessary setup steps needed before the actual process. The benefits of this preparing will come handy in the future. What you’re going to need is: PC capable of virtualisation – Since the image creation will happen in VM (Virtual Machine), we need hardware capable of this. If you’ve got a dedicated machine already – that’s great – if not, then any computer manufactured within the last few years, which can afford at least 2GBs of memory for virtualisation (you can assign less than 2GBs of memory, but everything will be slow. Like really, slow) and hard disk space – only you know how much space you’re going to use for this task. However, bare in mind you should allow extra space for the checkpoints. If you can afford to use SSD that’s great – it hugely improves the speed of the process. Windows 10 ISO file – you’d need this to install the actual image and to create so-called “answer” file out of it. Windows ADK – this will be used for creating the answer file. Hypervisor with checkpoint function – this will allow us to create a VM with the actual image, while checkpoints can save plenty of time in case something goes wrong or must be amended. Software and customisation files which are going to be shipped with Windows. Drivers. Internet – not necessary, but really helpful. As long as you’ve got the hardware capable of virtualisation, the rest comes from the Internet, or your software repositories.

I can only think about 2 free options here – first is Microsoft Hyper-V, which comes built in Windows 8 or 10 in Pro edition, or any Windows Server since 2008 version. If you don’t have a such a possibility, you can use VirtualBox, which is free and has desired checkpoints functionality. Obviously, any hypervisor with checkpoints feature should do the trick. I’ll be using Hyper-V since I’ve got Windows 10 Pro in my setup. To install Hyper-V on either Windows client or Server, make sure that Virtualization is enabled in your BIOS/UEFI setting, this is often called Intel VT, AMD-V or simply Virtualization Technology. In order to instal Hyper-V in Windows Clients, go to Control Panel\u003ePrograms and Features\u003eTurn Windows features on or off. Then expand Hyper-V menu and make sure that you can tick Hyper-V Management Tools and Hyper-v Platform. You will need to reboot the PC for the role to become active.

Make sure the disk you’re going to use will have at least the amount of space you plan to use for your VM. You can choose either generation, but I strongly recommend Generation 2 (which is supported for Windows 2012/8 onwards), generation 2 allows you to simulate UEFI, boot from SCSi adapters (which perform faster than IDE) and are power-failure proof.

It will e.g. automatically log in to the Administrator account, which will be removed once the work in the Audit mode has been finished.

The process of installing is almost the same for Audit and OOBE mode, however, I’m going to indicate the moment when you need to make the call. Start the VM. On the screen “Press any key to boot”, press any key. On the “Windows Setup” screen, choose Install now. Now you’re going to be asked to provide a licence key. In case you don’t have it yet, you can simply skip this and provide the key later. Choose the edition of Windows 10 which you’re going to install. I recon it’s going to be Pro, which will allow you, among other things, join the computer to the domain. Once you are aware of the agreement content, tick the box and move forward. Since this is a freshly created VM, its hard drive it’s literally empty. Therefore the only thing you can do now is to choose Custom: Install Windows only. On the following screen just click next, Windows installer will partition the drive and utilise all space. Even if you’d need additional partitions, you’ll be able to order Windows to create them during the deployment process. This slideshow requires JavaScript. The Windows installation starts now. It will take some time and reboots before reaching the next screen, on which you’ll need to make a decision about the mode used for installation. The Audit mode trigger is hidden; you must use a keyboard shortcut to activate it. Press simultaneously ALT + SHIFT + F3, after which VM will instantly restart and boot to audit mode shortly. Windows will now automatically log in with Administrator’s account, and present you with SYSPREP (System Preparation Tool) window, which you’d like to cancel. The tool allows you to set Windows 10 back to OOBE mode generalise (which I’ll explain later on) and restart it. Just cancel it. It might be worth to take a check point at this moment.

We could use so-called guest services and start copying all the installation files, but that would take first time to do so, secondly the size of the VHD would start growing. Rather than that, let’s go good, old network sharing.

Main PNPUTIL switches which you should know about: /enum-drivers - enumarates (lists) all stored drivers /add-driver - adds driver to the driver store /delete-driver - removes the driver from the driver store Driver store – what is this? Windows comes with plenty of drivers out of the box – however, it’s impossible to include every single driver to every single device, or even make sure that all the drivers are up to date. Therefore, here comes the idea of the Driver Store – think about it like installers for your software – you have the installer, but you install the software when it’s actually needed by the user. Same happens with the hardware – when a new device is connected, Windows goes through the store and looks for the appropriate driver. That way we can load all needed drivers and Windows will use them only when they are needed. This is cool, isn’t it? Let’s add some drivers!

Since this is VM, there a just a few in use. Type *pnputil /add-driver .inf /subdirs. This will order pnputil to go through all the folders and add any driver it finds to the store. It might take a while depending on amount and size of drivers you’ve prepared. Upon the completion, you’ll see how many drivers have been added to the store. This slideshow requires JavaScript. This is it, that one step closer to the hardware neutral Windows image. Enumerate the drivers now, see how many has been added to the Drivers now. Don’t forget to take the checkpoint. Unattended installation Are we there yet? Yes, almost there! Once you are happy with all customisations you’ve just done, it’s time to tell Windows, what to do during the installation. Why? To not get all that prompts about licencing, partitioning, the name of the computer and user etc. We are going to be like this bartender from the local pub, who knows us good enough to serve everything we like. Sounds cool? Keep it coming then! I must admit, I was really impressed (like WOW impressed) when saw fully automatic Windows deployment for the first time in my life – from the beginning of the process – when Windows configured itself until it reached the Logon/Desktop screen.

Essential part of it is the Answer file – the file which will tell Windows installer what to do during the installation. We obviously, are going to create are own answer file. We are going to need WIM file, which is in short take, the actual compressed Windows – whenever you install Windows, it’s being decompressed and installed to the local hard disk. Where’s the file then? You’ve guessed it right, on the Windows 10 ISO, the same which we’ve used to install Windows 10 earlier on. Microsoft started using ESD files to include Windows installation files, which are way more compressed than actual WIM files. Therefore first step is to copy the ESD file off the ISO, then convert it to the WIM file to finally use for the Answer file creation. Right click on the ISO which you’ve used to install the Windows 10, mount it. ISO will show as ordinary DVD drive, open it and go to the “Sources” folder, and find install.esd file. It’s the biggest (approximately 4GBs) file over there. Copy the file off the image. I can suggest to create a dedicated folder where you’re going to store all ISOs used for installation and another folder called WIM where you’ll store WIM files. The reason behind is that you should always use the WIM file from ISO used for installation. Don’t forget about meaningful names. We need elevated (administrator) command prompt, right click on the Windows menu and choose it then. Change directory to where the ISO is. You can use DIR command to make sure you’re in the right folder and can see install.erd file. Type command: dism /Get-WimInfo /WimFile:install.esd You should see the list of available Windows 10 edition included in the ISO. I’m going to need Pro edition therefore will choose Index:1 Type command: **dism /export-image /SourceImageFile:install.esd /SourceIndex:1 /DestinationImageFile:Windows10_pro_1607.wim /Compress:max /CheckIntegrity **I’ve highlighted the index number and the file name in case you’d like to change it.

But before deploying it to the actual physical machine, it’s worth to test it within the actual VM. Why? Because due to checkpoints, it’s extremely easy to roll back the deployment, amend the setting and deploy once again. It’s a real time saver.

Capturing and deploying the image Once your VM is up to the standard it’s time to send it to the actual hardware and see if everything still works + all drivers are working. However, it’s beyond this article as there are many tools which can be used. If you’ve got any favourite tools which can get the job done – let me know! A few tips: Always take the checkpoint before syspreping. Windows has a sysprep counter, and after generalising an image few times it will not allow you to generalise it another! This means you’d need to create another image from the scratch. On the other hand, if you’ve got a VM with checkpoint just before sysprep, you can always come back to it, amend it, checkpoint it and sysprep again, unlimited number of times. If there are too many checkpoints (and not enough hard disk space), you can always remove all of them and create a new one. Creating the image is a long process – take your time!

Files. Videos of your children since they were born. Years of company’s spreadsheets. Gone. It’s not going to be a good week, for sure. There are 2 kinds of people… According to one of the IT jokes, there are two kinds of people: ones who do back up, and the ones who will. If you are in the first group, you’re good and can go and enjoy the sun rain (did I mention I’m based in the UK?), or you can read through and later send this article to your mates. If you are in the “I will do backup” group, better have a seat, and rethink your attitude. Because it’s been very wrong. We usually don’t realise that something’s important to us until we lose it (that’s why there are tons of love songs about that she/he dumped him/her), and while retrieving data might be possible, it will cost you a lot of stress, time and (probably) money. The worst part is, there is no guarantee to successful recovery. The file loss is like a diarrhoea , it comes out of blue The reason might be anything, at any time. It suddenly happens, and when we realise it, it’s already too late. The device or hard drive might die, the files might be ‘accidentally’ damaged deleted by your ex-partner, your online backup might simply disappear – just because it’s been hosted by some 3rd party company. Imagine a situation when your manager, or (what’s worst) your partner comes to you and asks for some documents/pictures from 5 years ago. At once, with a smile on your face you answer easily: ‘There you go’. A few clicks later you realise the files are not there, and don’t remember moving them anywhere. Typical. You can ask for some time, and remain silent. At the given moment, there’s only hope left (and believe me, that’s a terrible feeling), that the files are somewhere else. The only action you can do is to go through countless number of folders, network share, USB sticks and CDs. How come there’s no any kind of a backup? Because the backup has never been made. You are the only one who knows the best, how much your files are actually worth. So I’m not going to do maths here, instead – I’d like to present you some options. And believe me – once done – you’ll sleep a way better. What do I need to do backup? There a quite a few options, most of them are one-off payment. Done.

Usually you must put all your files in one dedicated folder. Then this folder is synchronised across all your devices. Cloud storage often supports versioning – multiple versions of one file.

It wasn’t even my first blog, in fact, it was a third one. But the main difference was I wanted to get to the world this time. Don’t just write for the sake of writing. Very first version of this website was more like a business card or a CV, rather than a blog. I don’t say how proud I was, but also must admit how wrong I was. My business card is my skills and recommendations – it didn’t need a special website pumping it. So I’ve scrapped it, to a blog-only style, with some links to my other work. The idea was great, but blogging wasn’t on my mind at the time given. Firstly, I’ve been hardly studying to move on with my career. Secondly, I’ve been hardly searching for a new job and studying – again – how to do it the best way. Thirdly, I’ve been flipping my personal life upside down. It all worked out beautifully and made me feeling a way better. But my blog was just sitting there, not updated and forgotten. So here comes new The thing that I haven’t been writing, posting and disappeared from social media doesn’t mean that I’ve forgotten about my blog. I’ve been thinking about it, how to bring to all its glory. I love it. Let me show you around the blog First of all, I’ve asked myself a question – Who am I writing this blog to? And my first thoughts were – to people who like to question why things happen in a certain way. Why we behave like we do. For people who like me, would like to pursue their future and take the best out of it, working hard in achieving these. Therefore, I’ve squeezed categories to only 4: Me \u0026 People – where I write about our behaviour, emotions and my views about these. IT – where I talk about technology, in plain language. I will not bother you with boring nerdy talk – I spend hours on a daily basis on this deep techy stuff, and want to show you what’s the best, most valuable and interesting to you. Let me be your guide here, and I’ll do the dirty stuff for you. Motivation – everything related to work, career and self-development. We spend at least 1/3 part of life in our jobs, let’s squeeze all the sweet juice out of it. Photography – my photos, photo sessions and travels documented mostly by pictures. I can feel comfortable within those topics, and more or less I’ve been writing about them. Now it will easily allow you to find your posts. Main page of the blog At the top, you’ve got a massive slider with my best and featured posts. Below you can find most recent posts organised by categories. I think it’s better when it is organised like that, rather than having only most recent posts. Thoughts are now part of the blog The idea of thoughts is just great. Short views put straights out of my mind onto a piece of paper put a life to the blog. It’s updated more often than ever. But having 2 blogs, even within the same domain, simply wasn’t comfortable. Thoughts is now just a category, so whenever I put something quickly and short, I set it as main category + thoughts. Social media It’s more difficult than I thought. Creating engaging content, reaching more people – it’s not as simple. There is still plenty to learn for me, actually, I think I’m still a newbie here, but hey, I hope one day I will learn it and understand thoroughly. Currently, you can find me mostly on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. And here comes my great favour to you: if you read my posts, see my photos and enjoy it – simply give me ‘like’, comment or even share what you see or read. It really helps me to reach out to more people and show them my content. It doesn’t cost much, and can really help me. Some time ago I’ve realised that I was selfish. I’ve been reading a lot of blogs or other content of people, but never showed them that I actually liked their work. I never realised that being a “passive” reader wasn’t really nice to them.

Early access is quite the new thing in the software world. It is nothing but paying for having access to unfinished product before it’s “official” release. In other words, we pay for being a guinea pig. Developers, rather than paying for solid tests performed by professional testers – they sell it (!) to customers. I could understand a free early preview, but paid preview? Internet gave us all huge possibilities on being up-to-date with everything. I know that developers love to share their software with the rest of the world as soon as possible. On the one hand you can provide us with the newest and (hopefully!) best versions of your software, on the other hand we can always benefit from your newest inventions. Dear developers, whenever you decide to take my money for your product, please make sure it’s polished and working as good as on your marketing materials.

We to try to maximise 24 hours every day. Time wasting is not an option. Therefore we try to squeeze as much as possible in a schedule. Beginning from very morning. Every morning we start fairly the same, fulfilling daily ritual. Make up, news, coffee – ready, steady, go – everything what make us ready to make a public appearance . So it’s 8 am, and we are certainly ready to leave. Despite the traffic, overcrowded public transport and finally – queues in the coffee shop – we made it through to the office. We can finally sit at the desk at 9 am. Again, consequently, task by task as time passes by we prove that we can make our best and get everything done, on time. 5:30 pm, time to go home. Quick shopping on the way back. Then we can spend the rest of the day with family, ourselves or just being lazy. Because we can. Everything is perfect. Everything is synchronised. We fulfil 24 hours to every second. We make sure that everything happens exactly when it should. Time is one of the greatest, seamless and simple inventions human being ever invented! And there is Southern. As the world is synchronised and we can arrange a meeting with different people being in different parts of the globe and different time zones. Southern has a difficulty to provide a train according to a schedule. When before going on holiday, we try to close as many projects as possible, Southern simply cancels the trains. “Temporary shortage of train crew” lasts for months, and when the train finally arrives, it’s like a can full of sardines – crowded and smelly. But every story should end up well, therefore here’s my take: because of all of these delays I can spend more time reading. It pushed me towards taking up driving lessons, which took me 10 long years to get around to do it. Everything has a bright side, it’s just a matter of finding the right angle of looking.

Having a choice is a great thing – I can pick stuff which really suits myself. In case I need, say, a teal corner 4 seater bed sofa, it’s just a matter of time and money I am prepared to spend, until I get one. But what happens when I don’t have too many options? When there are 2 things which really suit me, but say, I’ve got space just for 1 sofa? I can tell what’s going to happen – I will spend ridiculous amount of time comparing, looking for details I like more, reading and watching an awful lot of reviews. I am terrible at making that kind of decisions, so before I commit, I need to make sure it’s the right one. I believe that you, similarly to me, make decisions on daily basis. The only 1st World Problem is like where should I get my lunch today, and we know very well, that this is sometimes a real mission. I really don’t want to mention here much more serious decisions. So it’s 1 pm, that amazing moment when I can start my journey to a sunny to the shops opposite. While most of them have similar assortment, there is always that long awaited question – ‘What are you having, today?’ Who knows, how could I know? Actually, at which point do you make decision that you prefer a baguette with tuna chunks, mayo, and sweetcorn from one shop than another? Ok, once tried all possible shops around you can prefer which actually taste better, but before that? All baguettes are “freshly prepared today”, similar sizes and cost – so where is that decision made? Well, it all apparently varies. Sometimes I could recall that brand name, sometimes logo appears to more than another, or maybe it is that cashier smiling nicely to you whenever you pass the shop? So I’ve made a decision some time ago, to keep my lunch pretty simple. Monday: Panini, Tuesday: tuna, Wednesday: meatballs, Thursday: ordinary sandwich from a local grocery shop, Friday: it’s Friday, I don’t care. Less is simple, less is better, less gives me more time. Did you notice that Steve Jobs or nowadays Mark Zuckerberg always wore the same cloths? Because it was simple, they didn’t need to waste time to decide “What am I wearing today?” Again, less is more. Another great example of less is more is photography – every good shot has a certain message to a viewer. If it is a portrait, then you can see a sharp face on the first plan, and blurred background. That’s it, that’s all about a good portrait. There are obviously other tricks like focusing the view on the eyes, cutting slightly on the top of the hair or so called rule of the thirds – but that’s additions which enhance the portrait. Eyes, face, action, emotions and expression – that’s the parts of the good portrait. And if you’ve got any other distraction like jewellery, objects or people on the background – then you are ruining your photo. Once again, less distractions is more for the overall photo. And there are hundreds of other examples like that – less in your CV, will allow the employer to focus on the most important parts of the CV. Doing only 1 task at the time rather than multitasking 10 at once will ensure that you will do the task better and faster, without the headache. Less is more, it’s always better to focus on quality. Apart from health, friends, and money – probably it’s better to have more than less of these.

I think I could made another passion from observing clouds in the garden. I would watch them for hours while they change their shapes, move around in the sky, still sitting in the chair and observing them pointlessly. No hobby, no interests to substitute the pointless activity(!) or rather lack or activity. I’m pretty certain you know people like that. They seem to unhappy. But not because something didn’t work out or they’ve just been dumped by their ex. The only reason is their very own ignorance to the rest of the world. In their view, there always could be something better. Certainly they would do something better than you, but somehow they’ve got more important stuff to do. Like watching TV. Or complaining. Or critisising. Or annoying those around them. The kill joy type, in its glory. Unless you are really lucky, everything comes with the price. You want your own house? No problem, go ahead and buy one. Oh, you don’t have enough money? Well, you can take mortgage and pay it off over the next three decades. Obviously, you will need to earn money to pay it off. But before they will do that they will moan and complain, undermine others’ achievements just to feel better. Screw you. In my mind things happen only to people who dare to take a risk, instead of passively sitting and wasting their life. I don’t want to be another surprised romantic who at the end of his life the only thing has to say: I’ve just had a bad day. Year. Life. It is not only about money, passion is ignored as well.

That’s not important that the last time he played football was years ago, back in high school, probably. He is the biggest supporter of his favourite team and he knows his stuff. Not the footballers who actually spend hours on daily basis sweating out like a horse in a western movie. I don’t just get one thing, one simple thing. If you admire something and you are calling yourself a fan, why do you criticise everything on every single occasion? How come that others try and make mistakes, and can live with that.

Usually it’s true, which we can confirm just after the unboxing ritual when we hold our brand new device in the hands. It’s shiny, without scratches, with a specific smell, plus it’s really fast and battery lasts very long. Until… we actually start using the phone, by this I mean installing the whole lot of our favourite apps. Some of them are just sitting there, not being used. By the way, the apps are comparable to instant messenger. What’s a point of using the best, fastest and most secured instant messenger when actually there is nobody to chat with. Same with mobile apps, if there are no mobile apps, it’s highly likely that we won’t use that mobile phone. As an example, let’s just look at once great and almighty BlackBerry as well as Windows Phone – they actually don’t have the same amount of decent applications as Android or iOS, and due to that reason, they are not that popular these days. My question here is – what is a difference between a brand new phone, and say, one month old one? The latter one will be definitively slower, and the battery will get be getting flat quicker. The core of the problem here is that the mobile phone’s operating systems run all the apps in the background. No matter what you do (OK, unless you try to get so called root rights, but let’s ignore it for the moment, as firstly it’s unofficial, secondly it’s likely to void your warranty. And it might brick your device) as long as the app installed, it runs in the background. Another problem here is, we can’t help that. The app runs in the background. That obviously impacts the performance as well as battery. Have you ever found your phone hot, but it was unused for a longer period of time? That’s what I’m talking about. Recently, I have removed the Facebook’s app from my phone (the reason wasn’t the performance, though) and noticed that phone has been working much faster, and has much more juice thought out the day. That lead me to an idea… If there is such a difference between the default system and the one we actually use, why we as customers, cannot have some kind of comparison before buying the phone? There could be a few users profiles: a business, teenager, and a photographer. Each profile would have a set of predefined apps running on it, and we as the customers would be able to see what is the actual phone’s performance and how long it would last on battery. I, as a practical guy, I’m rather after the real results than theoretical ones.

My last 2 days had been like: Wake up, shower, work, coffee, home, dinner, coffee, sleep. Exciting, isn’t it? For the past 2 days my memory was like ROM – Read Only Memory – mission was to think clearly. And of course I was like Pentium 4 class of processor – single threaded. No way of multitasking. So what to do? I thought that silent mode was enough to keep me out of distraction. First thing I did was removing Facebook app from my mobile devices. If I think about it now, I had been checking it every time I had I had a spare moment. Waiting for coffee to be served? Quickly check Facebook. Waiting for server to reload data? Quickly check Facebook. Never ending check check check. I follow quite a few blogs and other websites on FB, how to actually keep a track of them? I simply added to Feedly. Feedly is RSS reader – put it simply – you dump there your favourite websites, and Feedly keeps track of all of them for you, keeping record of all the new articles published on that websites. And you can browse them, whenever you’d like to. Like an email – all messages are waiting for you in your mailbox, until you’ve got time to actually read them.

And they had been sitting there. In a few cases – forever. Today I’ve organised them by: today, this week, this month, next month. As simple as that. And guess what, I’ve completed all tasks schedule for today! The best thing about it is I don’t need to think about them anymore. Plus, I don’t need to think about upcoming events foe the following weeks, because they are planned just for the next week. Satisfaction from completing all planned tasks and having planned next week is obviously big, I know it was a good change.

One of them is self-investment. Something what I do entirely for myself, because I am convinced that it will be beneficial to me, eventually. At the beginning of my IT journey, I sacrificed a lot of time. There were whole weekends with computer as well as late nights during a week. I wasn’t aware that this could have been an actual investment, that I was working towards bettering my future. Because at the time, it was nothing but pure fun. A few years later, the rumour spread (as it usually does, in a small town) about a computer whiz-kid who could fix computers. I was getting stopped by acquaintances, with questions type of ‘Could you please bring my computer back to life?’ There was no way I could say no to such question. Soon enough I’ve noticed a need in it, that there were more and more people with computers who couldn’t actually maintain them. Therefore, I have started charging clients for my time. Because I could. But, apart from the money aspect there has been something more valuable – knowledge and experience. Any opportunity and any spare time I had I dedicated to widen IT wisdom. Because I wanted to know everything about it. Be the IT Kung-Fu Karate Master, who could answer and resolve people’s issues with computers. Do you know what’s the difference between an amateur and a professional? The professional pays a great deal to every single detail, and can understand and explain why things happen in certain way.

In fact, it wasn’t that perfect routine, but at least I kept it. Well, that was the trouble I believe, my routine wasn’t perfect as normally. Actually, it was fairly below expectations. It was like a cheap replacement. And the baseline was – I like to keep my standards. If I do something seriously, I can only improve my expectations, but never go below them. Maybe that’s why I always try to improve whatever I do? The beauty and curse of perfection is that the more time you spend on something, the more time and effort you need to make an improvement. Even in IT, every serious IT department has its own routine. Check backups, review update and patching process or check status of servers. Even such a detail as naming convention is really important and must be consistent – otherwise finding certain rule or group of people might be extremely hard, as the name very can tell what exact thing is doing.

Words which make us feel good, because we can rely on others. I remember when sometime ago, I needed to push a new software to about 50 computers. As always, with that kind of operation, there was a very limited time to do this. In normal situation, there is deployment solution in place – a server which distributes the software in an automated way. Obviously, as an administrator I need to prepare the whole process – finding installers, commands and switches for these software and even writing scripts. I did prepare everything and tested thoroughly – and at the day of deployment the server decided not to co-op at all. Jobs have been breaking, connections were dropping – the IT nightmare in all it’s glory. The second deployment server was out of question under current circumstances. Tragedy, literally tragedy did happen. Because I couldn’t rely on this any more, I had to override manual mode – a bunch of USB sticks with all the files, scripts on it, that is. Yep, I ended up running around from one end point to another and sticking the flash drives in. It really helps when you are responsible for preparation of the whole process, I tend to observe the whole process when it happens, with every detail that happens.

What to do in that case? I showed K. my phone – Xiaomi Mi4 – and presented its functions, how it performs and told her that it was actually one of my best phones I’ve ever had. It didn’t take long when she asked for the price, which was a way much less then she was used. Like 2-3 times lower than other brands. It didn’t take long to order the phone! Boom, the magic was done, there will be another happy Xiaomi user. I must admit, K. wasn’t the first person I’ve convinced to the less known brand.

I can remember different things quite easily, organise and plan them in my mind. A serious and complex task is not a big deal to me, as long as I can understand it. At times I can be annoying (I guess some might say that), by asking many questions, as understanding of each step is a baseline to completing every task correctly. But there is something magical in writing down the tasks. Using to-do list might be efficient, as the task sits in the screen and stares directly into my eyes. But once finished, I can only click it to mark as completed. I can tick the box, feel good that I’ve completed the task, but there is no satisfaction. Just job done, I can move on. In all my nerdish nature, I really am getting into writing on paper. Computer allows me to delete wrong things, like they never existed. It’s such a perfect and soulless thing. Piece of paper on the other hand is something more natural. I can see the process of getting into something, how my thoughts evolve from imperfect first idea to final and mature mind.

Sometimes they make a promise to themselves “I spend too much time at work, therefore I should spend more time with my family.” Sometimes, something happens what drives us to the change “My father died, I should have spent more time with my family.” And sometimes some people actually do that. At some point each of us has heard the sentence: “You’ve changed”. What does it actually mean? People move on with their lives. No one would like to start the life and stop at the same point. Studies show, that people change their character every 7 years. Personally, I believe that number varies significantly and depends on the person and circumstances around you. That’s why one day we might ask ourselves why actually we are still hanging out with the group of these people. That’s why we lose and gain interest in different hobbies, jobs, partners and gadgets.

We are pushed through countless tests and exams, and being challenged on daily basis. And there is always somebody, who in a good faith has to say that “you won” even though we actually did not. Mr Goleman in his book, Emotional Intelligence, presented controversial at the time of publishing, study that the IQ isn’t the determinant of our intelligence. Instead, the emotional intelligence is. So what defines the emotional intelligence? Cutting a long (and brilliant!) story short, emotional intelligence is how the person can understand, express and control emotions of self and others. Let’s look around, definitively you can name a few school mates amongst whom some of them had been scoring great grades, some average and some were low. According to IQ, the better the grades, the better the life standard should be, shouldn’t it? However, life varies, and so often we find those best scoring folks not getting the best positions. Quite often it’s the opposite. The average and average-low scoring fellows often become employers rather than employees or get senior positions whereas, those with high IQs can’t adjust.

First time in over 10 years. Does it mean something is ending? I’d call it a big change. But let me take you step by step. Do you remember that we live in post-PC era? Yep, a few years ago news have been screaming and shouting that that’s it for a computer era – tablets and smartphones were supposed to take over and certainly – as media blindly believed – would be enough for most of the world. But guys forgot to mention that technological progress slightly changed its direction in the last couple of years. Basically, because of two things: Computers became really powerful. If you’d like to browse the Internet, watch video in full HD, listen to music, store your photos then well – any PC which was made more or less 8 years ago would do. 8 years! That’s plenty in technology. So, most of the people have had computers which could handle day to day tasks, what’s a point of buying a new toy? For a last few years, the actual performance of computers isn’t raising as rapidly as, say, 15 years ago. Rather than improving speed and performance of computers, manufacturers focus on power efficiency (so that you can take your laptop to work without a charger), miniaturisation (so that when you buy modern PC you can play video in 4K and play even some 3D games), and once again – miniaturisation (so that computers are smaller and lighter). Microsoft is giving away Windows 10 for free for anyone with Windows 7 or 8 licence. That is, for each computer released after July 2009. I know that new version of Windows might not be a reason to buy a new PC, but it was always nice to have a new PC with a shiny new OS on it. Literally, we can have the newest OS on the 7 years old computer. For free and legally. Awesome. And we can see the effect of this on yearly basis – manufacturers sell less and less of computer (e.g. Sony sold Vaio brand 3 years ago, that were really a state of art laptops. Samsung stopped making laptops), and it’s matter of time when the prices will grow up. I don’t want to mention the reductions in staff. So what about the smartphones? Although computers always have been about getting more and more powerful – getting more Gigahertzes and cores, More and faster memory etc. – smartphones were surprising us in many ways. Better camera, better speakers, bigger screen, higher resolution, more memory, amazing design and obviously – more power. In my view the biggest wow in the whole smartphone revolution was first iPhone, back in 2007. You know, a proper multi-touch, gestures, great look, proper applications, flawless workflow – you name it – it was a pure touch of something new. Revolution, which combined many of the features from other phones, put it together, done it better, added some magic and passion – and boom – everyone wanted a smartphone since then. Everyone wanted a smartphone since then – because it was something completely new and fresh. Soon enough the competition was joined by Google with android (and Blackberry, Microsoft – but as we know at the moment – not really successful). And again, like with computers a decade before, each year we could see newer, better and bigger smartphones. Moreover, usually we replace them every 2 years during contract extension. Billions of people, billions of smartphones “refreshed” quite often and boom – after almost 10 years since first iPhone and world says (quietly, so far) enough of this. You can easily use 3-4 years old phones this time. Because, seriously – apart from phoning, texting, watching cats and watching videos and taking photos what else do we do with the phones? Functionality stayed the same. Obviously there is still a lot to do with mobile phones, but the improving part is getting slower and slower. Sooner or later we might see optical zooms, wide used VR, maybe holograms and other features – but it doesn’t change the main idea of the phones – keeping people connected.

Quite often I was reinventing the wheel and discovering already discovered lands. Well, that gave me a lot practice, and no doubts, made me who I am now. But how could I actually proof my skills? You can be a specialist… while being an amateur It’s not a secret that I have spent major part of my life providing outsource IT support. This allowed me to understand different industries and make connections with different people. But every single time when the question ‘How did you learn all this stuff’ came up, my answer was ‘I have learnt it myself’. I was proud of it, and I am still proud of it. I am proud because I could solve many problems without anybody’s help. Literally. When I was starting my IT journey, 15 years ago, there wasn’t the Internet at home (well, there was, but dial up one, goddamn expensive. And slow.) In addition I was forced to try different ways of solving problems, often I had to identify different hardware problems, or find a way to bring the OS back to working state. When there is no solution given, you need to provide one. Trying various methods means discovering new possibilities. And because you are doing, working out and learning new solutions, it is more than granted that you will retain the knowledge. Much longer than the actual only read knowledge. We tend to follow one certain path, which we’ve been taught. Usually we don’t even try to question the path, if it is actually the best/easiest/fastest one. We take it for granted, and I think this is very wrong. Instead of finding something what really suits us, or at least improve the current situation, we follow one certain way. Like the lemmings. Being self-taught benefited me a lot. But also limited in certain ways. I knew only areas which I really needed to know without going beyond …. Certification will enwiden your views After years of supporting different versions of Windows, I thought I knew it through and through. I couldn’t be more wrong. I was aware of everything what I have learnt (how ironic this sounds?) and nothing else. You don’t know how surprised I was when I started to study for MCSA certification. The whole new world of possibilities has appeared in front of my eyes! Unbelievable, how limited my knowledge was. There are so many features and tools hidden in Windows you wouldn’t believe. I could get rid off so many 3rd party tools because most of them have been already included with Windows. Certification will allow you to master the topic You probably passed tens of exams in your life. Each of them proved your knowledge in certain areas. There is no difference in here. There won’t be any doubts when you are certified Take a look at this: we’ve got 2 IT specialists. One of them will claim that he or she can support Windows, recover data, made a migration to newer version of OS, configure the network and is proficient in office applications. The other guy will tell that he or she holds MTA, MCSA, MCP, MOS and CCNA certifications which proves his knowledge. Which one sounds better and which one would you choose? For me, the choice is obvious. I literally hated the part when I was meeting a new customer/employer and being questioned about my knowledge. Without certification you may look like an amateur, and therefore be treated as one. This made me think, that despite my self-taught skills I had to provide a piece of paper regardless. “How ridiculous” I thought, “Why won’t ya just let me show you my skill” I said. Well, I soon realised that… Certification improves your chances of getting hired This is big. We all need to earn money, so we either try to get employed or get hired.

Sometimes the way how negative situations happen describe the way our day, week, life look like. The way we are. Funnily enough, very often those things or people are just happening around us, the way we often don’t even notice it. We often can only notice the result of all those things. Some call it an energy, some call it the fate, and some simply call it the life. You can call it whatever you like, but it is important to be conscious about how the world affects us. So let’s start from the most important part of the life and choose… THE RIGHT PEOPLE Yes, you read me right – right people. We cannot escape from them. We need to interact with them. So literally, we need to feel comfortable with them. Moreover, they should stimulate us to do more things. Have you ever felt that you can do more with certain people; that your approach changes from ‘well, maybe, but not yet‘ to ’Yeah! Let’s do it!’ because somebody next to you is vibrant, full of an energy? Or maybe you’ve got somebody who you are not shy to share your personal stuff, like pictures, poems, playing on an instrument. There are so many things that we keep for ourselves from the outside world because we are afraid of rejection and lack of understanding. If you’ve got somebody like that – the right person – you are a very lucky guy. You can develop and reinvent yourself when you are not scared of showing off. You can act, perform and make things working. You can go out, shout ‘This is me, and this stuff I do. And believe me, I am the best’. Just look around the Internet – blogs, YouTube, SoundCloud – all those artists are mostly amateurs, or started as the one. They were not scared to show off their skills to the whole world. If there were not, why it cannot be you? I hope this is a good reason for you to understand why you should… AVOID THE WRONG PEOPLE I believe you could foresee it. Who is the wrong person? Anyone who makes you feel uncomfortable. Embarrassing. When it is weird to act as you would normally do. Obviously, it is not always possible to find the right people around you, especially when you work, study or even party. At least try, because when you will be around positive individuals, sooner or later, just like out of blue, you’ll… GET INSPIRED One of the worst feeling in life is when you are getting bored.

Time was passing slowly, I was ending up usually with a headache.

I didn’t play right for the first time, nor for second but after many attempts I could actually play pretty well. I was just keeping trying. One day I took my guitar outdoors and met with my mates. They didn’t know I was actually playing a guitar. Well, no surprise, I never told them. Then I realised that some of my friends were into music, and guess what happened next? As soon as we started meeting more often, writing songs and playing covers, we knew we were the right people in the town. We played for fun, just for ourselves. It was never a successful band as we were hidden away in the dungeon of our basement (literally ;)). After few months, when I went abroad, we drifted apart. I actually didn’t play guitar much after this period, but Patrick, the lead singer recently has released his first album!

And how to avoid unnecessary money and time waste? You need somebody who thinks out of the box, is determined and the most important – has tons of experience. Below you can see how I was gaining experience and how it helped me to be where I am right now. I always considered myself as the guy who’s got practical knowledge. When I was setting up my first PC (in times of Windows 98) I learnt by myself how to partition and set up Windows. Well, it was journey full of obstacles, as the words “partition” or “volume” were absolutely new to me. In other words: I didn’t know what they really meant, I just knew I needed them to install OS. These were the dark times without the internet so everything I was doing was done by method called “let’s see what will happen if I select this”. Very often this method was followed by “well, I need to start over, again”. Obviously, after many attempts I managed to set up the OS and realised I couldn’t play my favourites games (I was 10 or even younger that time) because screen resolution and colours were horrible. Later on, I learnt that there is another piece of software, apart from OS, that you need to make your computer fully operative – drivers. Anyway, that gave me a lot of practice. And practice is when something is working, but you don’t know why. This is fine, until something breaks down. The birth of an amateur In other words, I became self-learnt-computer-amateur. I was proud and I think I still should be, as nowadays kids are proud of themselves when they manage to install a game on their parents’ mobile phone. Excuse me, I was able to set up the computer and install games apart from that. I stayed an amateur for the next few years. Pretty quickly I managed to earn some money in my town as the word did spread quickly. I became a local computer-master. A guy who can do it quicker and better than a local repair centre. I really valued my customers, so as a result I always customised and optimised their computers to their actual needs. I could stop there. There was money flow, there were new customers, and new devices were introduced on the market like GPS or smartphones. Yet, it started to be boring: lack of new challenges, lack of new technologies and ideas. I wanted to do and know more. When I was 19, I made a decision to take up NVQ classes in Computer Science. I wanted to learn something new and become qualified. Being town’s nerdest guy wasn’t enough. I attended classes and learnt a lot of theory the basics of computer networks. Yes, computer network is what I was after since that time. I graduated and was the only one (out of the whole group) who passed the exams successfully. I was 21 when this happened with NVQ Level 3 certificate. It still wasn’t enough for me – the town would neither never change, nor give me the new opportunities. All in all, I made another decision – I needed to leave my home town. I needed the city with hundreds of thousands people and companies who will throw challenges into my face. Therefore I went straight to London, where I was surrounded by newest technology and enterprises. That was on 7th of July 2010. An exact month before my 22nd birthday. The real challenge has come London. Big city, with many people and companies. As well with many other guys like me. Here you can be easily replaced. Competition is huge. Therefore you must be conversant with areas of your expertise, plus you must learn quickly. With IT you need to have a lot of experience or much more time and patience to do something properly. The problem is – companies quite often don’t have much time and will be not happy to pay for your wasted time. Imagine a situation when I had a lot of experience solely with computers, but not groups of, e.g. 30, which must be configured simultaneously. Computer network was the obvious answer – but how actually does it work? You need a server which controls clients.

But it really hit me about 4 years ago, when I bought some Panasonic camera with 16x zoom. It was only at that particular time that I thought zoom was the most important feature of a camera. Well, I can now say that it is cool to have zoom, but without vibration reduction you cannot do much on long focal length. Anyway, time passed and I was taking some photographs, when I was showed by my old mate what was a macro photography. The view of detailed items really impressed me. But hey, it was all about taking pictures whenever I could, without focusing on advanced options. After that, I bought my first high-end mobile phone. I was surprised (apart from specs of course) by its camera. Soon I realised that I really did not need the compact camera anymore, so I gave it to my brother. And stayed for good with mobile camera for the next 2 years. During holiday time, my family came over and guess what – my brother brought the Panasonic camera with him – and obviously we were taking photos. After a day out, we sat in the front of my full HD TV and played some photos. That was it. I realised that camera from mobile phone actually isn’t that great. I could clearly see a quality difference between dedicated camera device and mobile phone camera. As photos from my mobile phone were noisy, photos from my brother’s camera were sharp. But something was wrong! My mobile phone was a few times more expensive than this compact camera! Well, life was brutal this time. I started to look for another camera. I learned that there are Compact, Bridge, System (or mirror-less) and DSLR cameras. As I wanted good quality of photos, with interchangeable lenses but not big and heavy camera itself, my choice went onto mirror-less camera. To be more specific – I chose Nikon 1 j1 with standard 10-30 mm lens. And it happened over a year ago. Like before with previous camera, I was stunned by the quality of pictures. And the speed of taking pictures – this camera was able to take 60 pictures per minute! Anyway, another good piece of hardware made my days for a long time. However, I found a few websites and blogs which were about photo business and/or hobby. I could see incredible pictures they had been taking. Well, I thought why shouldn’t I try? I armed myself in some online tutorials, YouTube videos and some settings. I did not know what Shutter speed was. Aperture was a mystery word to me. I knew that the higher ISO, the brighter picture, but I did not know high ISO causes noise to the pictures. My proper manual photography education started off with 2 books: “Mastering Digital Photography” by Jason Youn and “The Digital Photography Book: Part 1” by Scott Kelby. The former book gave me all the theory I needed, the latter how to put theory into practise. In the meantime, I understood the reason to use tri-pod and why soft-light (or even golden hour) is what photographer is looking for. As a result, my photo skills rapidly shot up and improved. I took thousands of photos and was never 100% satisfied. There was always something I could have corrected or improved. About a month ago, I asked my good friend Robert to lend me his DSLR. He has Nikon d80 with 18-135mm lens. The quality of photos (bear in mind this DSLR was 5 years older than my Nikon 1 j1) was stunning. As I was practising my Nikon 1 for over a year, I could take a better quality pictures straight away with Nikon d80, and all the functions were under my fingers. With Nikon 1, when I wanted to change mode from automatic focus to manual, I had to go to special menu, change function, come back to taking photos mode, click ok, adjust focus setting, confirm, and take a picture. I know I missed many great possibilities of taking good photos. With DSLR the manual focus is a matter of switching mode on lens, adjust the ring and take a pic. It takes 2 second in comparison to 20.

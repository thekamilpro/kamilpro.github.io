Side note, I was meant to publish this back in March 2023...

When I attended my first PowerShell meetup back in 2017, I had no idea it would lead me to where I am today.

Fast forward to 3rd of March 2023, I was privileged to speak and share my knowledge with other #PowerShell enthusiasts at #PsDayUk conference. I presented the PowerShell based web server and web framework, which enables anyone familiar with the language, to create web applications.

There were questions, there were raised hands, there was a conversation between me and other attendees - I hope everyone left with a wonderful experience.

Looking back and thinking that a few years ago I knew nothing about PowerShell, let alone writing code is just mind blowing.

I would like to thank everyone who came to my presentation, and everyone who has been with me on the journey.

Itâ€™s the support and encouragement of the community that keeps me motivated!

The journey is never ending. Journey before destination.

## Congratulations!

This is 20th and last lesson in the course &#8211; and my aim here is to show you various paths you can take your PowerShell journey to.

I&#8217;m going to show what else you can do within PowerShell itself, as well how to keep up-to-day plus &#8211; what other doors writing code has opened for you &#8211; I&#8217;d love to hear back about this!

I hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed the course so far and it will be helped you in some way &#8211; either solve a problem, got promotion, or simply learnt something new. Let me know!

## Will there be any other courses or videos?

Possibly, however, I&#8217;ve got nothing planned now. 

Making the course was an experiment for me trying to work with video rather than blogging, and certainly it appealed to me. 

I would really appreciate any feedback you might have, as well as ideas of what you&#8217;d like to learn about.

## How can we stay in touch?

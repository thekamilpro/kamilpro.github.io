## About files solve issue

If after running _Update-Help_ you don&#8217;t have About topics, you might want to manually <a href="https://kamilpro.com/manualupload/about_help.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">download </a>them and extract the archive to the root of:

C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\en

## PowerShell help &#8211; Exercises

PowerShell is great in working with CSV files. Can you find help for any CSV related commands (you will need to use a wildcard)

Can you tell what&#8217;s a difference between _ConvertTo-CSV_ and _Export-CSV_ commands

We often need to review event logs &#8211; which command would allow you to retrieve event logs?

Once you found the command for retrieving Event Logs, can you tell if there are any mandatory parameters? Read help, and see if you can find that information, and then run command to confirm your findings

Is PowerShell capable of creating folders and files? You might search for Item to find out

How would you list all the files/folders in current folder?

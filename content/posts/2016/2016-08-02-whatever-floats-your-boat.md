How many times I’ve put my all enthusiasm into something, being convinced that it was the right thing.

Hundreds, maybe thousands of times.

How many time afterwards I have realised that my belief was completely wrong. Like 100% wrong. Like back to front feeling.

I think the most difficult is the moment of making a decision. That very moment when it’s time to commit to a long standing decision. The second when it’s time to reveal self and go public.

Then, here comes the moment, a short hesitation followed by questions: Am I actually right? Maybe my views are wrong?

Screw it, let’s do it!

Probably you’ve heard about comfort zone. About stepping out of your very own comfort zone. Life coaches and other so-called masters ‘Know it all’ say this is the most important step of the whole decision making process. Well, I disagree.

Stepping out of the comfort zone is just the beginning.

Often we find ourselves not as good as expected. So what, then? What should we do when there is no road full of roses with a rainbow above it? And all these coaches answer their phones with the red button? You will trip and fall, rise and fall again

Well, keep up. At the end of the day, it’s your life. And nobody will live it better, than you.

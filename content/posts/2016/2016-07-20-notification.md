I carry with me 2 phones &#8211; personal one and work one. On the first one, I store only personal stuff, while on the 0ther one everything what is work related.

I have been using my phones like probably most of the people &#8211; putting them on vibration while in the restaurants, office etc. so that the phones wouldn&#8217;t annoy people around me. But, something&#8217;s changed when I was sent for a business trip abroad.

Obviously, I didn&#8217;t switch on roaming on my personal phone, because what&#8217;s the point of paying for the Internet, especially when I had my work mobile with data on. I didn&#8217;t even connect to the WiFi in the office, just because.

But something has changed. My workflow was going well until I realised what had changed &#8211;  I wasn&#8217;t distracted any more. Because I was not getting notifications of any kind, my phone has been lying silently next to my laptop while I could work without any disturbances. And guess what: I wasn&#8217;t even tempted to check my phone for anything.

It was a little detail which I have discovered completely by an accident. From that time, my phones are always put on &#8220;do not disturb&#8221; while I am at work, meeting, or simply need to focus or relax.

While computers or other smart-devices can multitask easily, we can&#8217;t. So rather than trying to be on top of everything, I rather focus on current task.

And as we talk about being focused, soundtrack from The Witcher 3 is perfect for staying focused:

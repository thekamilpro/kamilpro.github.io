# Basic version

switch ( test-value ) {
    condition {do-stuff}
    another condition {do-stuff}
}
#>

# This will print out Green
switch (2) {
    0 { "Blue" }
    1 { "Yellow"}
    2 { "Green"}
    3 { "Red"}
}

# Work with variable
$number = 1
switch ($number) {
    0 { "Blue" }
    1 { "Yellow"}
    2 { "Green"}
    3 { "Red"}
}

# Assign variables within scriptblock 
$number = 3
switch ($number) {
    0 { $result = "Blue" }
    1 { $result = "Yellow"}
    2 { $result = "Green"}
    3 { $result = "Red"}
}
Write-Host "The result is: $result" -ForegroundColor $result

# We can also assign statement to variable
$number = 0
$result = switch ($number) {
    0 { "Blue" }
    1 { "Yellow"}
    2 { "Green"}
    3 { "Red"}
}
Write-Host "The result is: $result" -ForegroundColor $result

#  Use default in case there's no match
$number = 8
$result = switch ($number) {
    0 { "Blue" }
    1 { "Yellow"}
    2 { "Green"}
    3 { "Red"}
    default {  
        Write-Warning "Unknown value, defaulting to White"
        "White" }
}

# Strings can also be matched
# This also shows working on expression
switch ( (Get-Host).Name ) {

# Arrays!
$employees = @("Developer", "Project Manager", "DevOps Engineer", "Developer", "Sysadmin")

    "Developer" {"We need a Developer!"}
    "Project Manager" {"We need Project Manager"}

}

# Using script block, when comparing value
$age = 25
switch ($age) {
    {$_ -ge 18} {
        "It's an adult"
    }

    {$_ -lt 18} {

# PowerShell will match multiple times
switch ("something") {

# Stop execution with break

# Enable wildcard

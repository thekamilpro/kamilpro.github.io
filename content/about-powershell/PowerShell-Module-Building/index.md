Organising all files, scripts and functions required to build a module might give one a headache. PowerShell doesn't come with native way of building the module, which doesn't make our job easier. 

Hence, we're going to use ModuleBuilder from PowerShell community so that the way we organise the code is predictable and used widely across other PowerShell projects.

In this video I'll walk you through the process of preparing, organising and finally building the module.

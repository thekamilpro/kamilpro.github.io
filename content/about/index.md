## Who am I?

Hi, my name is Kamil Procyszyn and I've always been driven by automating things. Automation led me eventually to PowerShell, which then opened a whole plethora of new things for me - Public Cloud, CI/CD Pipelines, Infrastructure as Code and lately Platform Engineering. I keep an eye on possibly disruptive technologies like AI.

I strive to make complex seamless... or at least simpler. 

## Some of my professional achievements

- Created liveProject for Manning: PowerShell and GitHub Actions
- Spoken at PS Day UK 2023 Conference
- Created KpPwpush PowerShell module

## Some of my certificates

- AZ-400: Azure DevOps Engineer Expert
- AZ-104: Azure Administrator
- MCSA: Windows Server 2012
- MCSA: Windows 8
- SAFE 6.0 Practitioner

## Privatly

While technology has always been part of my life, there are several other elements that make me complete, so let's pick the top three I attend daily.

Books. I go through fiction and non-fiction. If I were to pick my favourite, fiction, that be The Witcher Saga by Andrzej Sapkowski. For non-fiction The Goal by Eliyahu M. Goldratt... ok, I realise it's a story, but the knowledge passed there is so practically and applicable in real I'll add it as non-fiction.

Music. I like to listen to... good music. My favourite guitarist is Joe Bonamassa. My favourite electronic music show is Group Therapy by Above and Beyond. One of my favourite songs is La Ciudad by Odesza.

Exercise. I got into lifting weights in June 2023. Since then I lift three times a week and run three times a week. It's simple and led me to so number of many other benefits: eating healthier, limiting alcohol, stopping drinking coffee, and getting more disciplined.

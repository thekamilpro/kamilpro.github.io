# PowerShell for IT Professionals


Hi and welcome in the PowerShell for IT Professional course!

The course is aimed at IT Professionals/system administrators that never coded before and manage Windows workloads.

To get started all you need is a Windows machine (I'd recommended server edition run as VM), in the course you can see me explaining and using commands, thus I strongly encourage you to follow along with me.

All the videos and related exercises are available for free and I am for each video to be 20-30 minutes long - thus you can easily find spare time to learn.

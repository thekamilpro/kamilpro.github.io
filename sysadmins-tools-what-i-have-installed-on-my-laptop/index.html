That’s what I use this software for.\nIt allows for RDP, SSH, SFTP, VNC and proably many more protocols I don’t even know about. Every connection has it’s own tab, thus jumping between open connections is just click away. On top of that, it can handle multiple credentials, which can be assigned to every connection you created.\nI’ve tried many connection managers before – paid and free – and this tool seriously shines. It’s also very stable, thus there’s no need to worry that at some point you might need to reopen all connection.\nIt’s true value for money.\nServer Manager – managing Windows servers https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2693643/remote-server-administration-tools-rsat-for-windows-operating-systems\nCategory: Free\nIf you’re managing Windows servers, this tool is simply a must – if you don’t use it, just install RSAT on your laptop (it’s free).\nIt debuted with Server 2012, and allows to add Windows-based server to it, and have a very quick information about them. Once you’ve added your servers there, it will break them down by server roles, so if you’d like quickly find your AD DS servers, just click dedicated tab of them. Need to quikcly check DHCP reservation? Just right click on DHCP server and bring up DHCP console.\nAnother great feautre is having a minal monitoring – you can specify CPU and memory treshold, and as soon as the server hit’s the limit – you’ll know it. It will also record the occurence, so that you can double click on it, and have a snapshot of what processes were crancking your server.\nI might be wrong here – but seems like that software is not in development anymore (at least I didn’t see any more new features, and didn’t fix old bugs), which is a shame. I’m aware of Windows Admin Center, but that tool can’t replace server manager yet.\nVMWare Workstation Pro – Virtual Machines https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro.html\nCost: Paid\nIf you spin up many VM’s on your laptop, then this application is a pure joy. I purchased it a year ago, mostly for creating labs for my studies and MCSA and oh boy, I wish I purchased it earlier on.\nThe big thumbs up for the tabbed view, thus jumping between VMs is quick and easy, the fact that shared clipboard always works (so no problems with copying files or text strings), creating new VMs from the snapshot of source VM – saving huge amounts of space. On top of all of that, Windows upgrades don’t break anything, and VMs can be easily moved between Windows and Linux hosts.\nIf you use any sort of virtualisation software and are not entirely happy with it, take this one for a spin.\nVisual Studio Code – Code editor https://code.visualstudio.com/\nCost: free\nI write PowerShell scripts, and picking this IDE was not a brainer – it’s official POSH editior. It obviously supports plaetora of other languages.\nCode is fast, multiplatform and have plenty of extensions. It hanged a few times, but that was probably something to do with my code I tried to run. It has debugging, source control and terminal built in. I didn’t use many IDEs so it’s quite hard to compare – but as a fairly new person to code, I find it cool.\nDameware – LAN remote connection https://www.dameware.com/dameware-mini-remote-control\nCost: Paid\nDameware is a tool which allows you to conenct directly to the console of the computer. It has a very low latency (at least on Windows 7, 8 and MacOS – Windows 10 is not as fluent). It works, to my undestaring, as a video driver thus mirrroring screen and allows direct interaction with computer, including admin passwords prompt.\nIn probably, it allows to chat with the user, file transfer, and because it’s working as a service, you can initiate connection without a user being logged on.\nI will keep updating the list This list is not finished, an wil be updated over time. I have been using all tools listed here, thus it’s a personal subjective list. I have ano affilation with any of the companies developing software listed above.\n","wordCount":"774","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2019-01-06T20:40:21Z","dateModified":"2019-01-06T20:40:21Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Kamil"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://kamilpro.com/sysadmins-tools-what-i-have-installed-on-my-laptop/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Kamil Pro","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://kamilpro.com/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://kamilpro.com/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://kamilpro.com/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://kamilpro.com/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://kamilpro.com/about-powershell/ title="About PowerShell"><span>About PowerShell</span></a></li><li><a href=https://kamilpro.com/powershell-course/ title="PowerShell Course"><span>PowerShell Course</span></a></li><li><a href=https://kamilpro.com/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://kamilpro.com/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://kamilpro.com/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Sysadmin’s tools – what I have installed on my laptop</h1><div class=post-meta>&lt;span title='2019-01-06 20:40:21 +0000 UTC'>6 January 2019&lt;/span>&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;4 min&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;774 words&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;Kamil&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/thekamilpro/kamilpro.github.io/tree/main/content/posts/2019/2019-01-06-sysadmins-tools-what-i-have-installed-on-my-laptop.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p>We need tools to make our work.

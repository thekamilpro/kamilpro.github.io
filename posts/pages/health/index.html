It all started with working on sleep, which got followed by sport, nutrition etc. where at this point it’s became part of my identity.\nThe goal here is to keep this post as a baseline to compare myself in the future, how much I drifted or improved over time, and then share to the any other person who wants work on themselves.\nDay timing I work from home; hence I could structure my working day around it. Times are obviously not set in stone, but it’s more or less a pattern I try to follow.\n7-8: Wake up 8: Breakfast 9: Double espresso 10-11: Walk for some 20-30 minutes 12:30: Lunch 13: Read a book 13:30: Leafy earl grey 17:30: Dinner 18: Leisure time, often going for another walk 19: Gym/Side Project/Learning… or just do nothing 21:30: Shower 22: Read a book 23: Usually already a sleep Few more details about how and why:\nI allow myself a lot of time for sleep, often I can get 9 or even 10 hours of sleep. But there are nights when 7 hours is sufficient. I just make sure there’s long enough window for sleep. The morning walk another tactic to help with sleep, morning light resets circadian cycle which is responsible for sleep cycle. I don’t listen to anything while walking - it’s just me and nature. I am to walk at least 7000 steps a day. Gym attending 3 times a week for mostly weightlifting, often I add 4th day in a form of a cardio. I avoid food past 20:00, 3 hours before going to sleep. Sleep Sleep is important, after two nights of bad sleep I can observe a performance hit on my productivity, small changes often can have huge effect on the quality of the sleep.\nExpose yourself to the morning sunlight, for at least 20-30 minutes. After numerous experiments with caffeine I got to the point where I don’t feel it impacting me even after dinner, but regardless I found a double espresso in the morning is all I need to get my coffee fix. Later on during a day I ten pick an earl grey tea, which seems to have a much lower content of caffeine, which is my preference. Walking minimum of 7000 steps seems to help me fall asleep easier, if I won’t hit that number falling asleep might be difficult. There must be a total darkness in the bedroom. Spicy or junk food often prevent me from falling asleep, or often wake me up around 3 or 4 in the morning. I turn off my mobile for the night and put it out of the arms reach. My phone is set to use greyscale, after one day of use like that I honestly can’t see any point of using colour phone, it’s also less tempting to use, and it seems to light is less invasive for the eyes. Kindle Paperwhite reading doesn’t seem to have an effect on my sleep, so it can be used in total darkness in the bedroom. First yawn is an indication the body is getting ready to sleep, put down the book and close the eyes straight after it. Resources for sleep: Book: Why we Sleep\nBook: Sleep: Change the way you sleep with this 90 minute read\nNutrition Avoid processed food. Best quality food usually doesn’t have a label on it. Drink only water, coffee, and tea. Avoid anything labelled as low fat, no fat etc. Usually there’s more sugar added to product compensate for taste. Eat foods with a lot of fibre in them Prioritise food with low calory density, e.g. potato has 4 times less calories than French fries. Because of that, you end up consuming way less calories. Don’t bother with calory counting, focus on picking the right food. Eat a handful of almonds a day. Homemade popcorn is a great snack. Having proteins after workout seem to prevent me from feeling pain in muscles following day. Once a week have a cheat day, that is whatever you want in amounts you want. Life is to enjoy after all. Alcohol is a poison. In the morning, more consumed calories go to muscles. In the evening, more consumed calories get stored as fat. My breakfast is often a combination of berries and nuts, with rolled oats on the gym day. After such breakfast, my lunch often is a simple raw carrot and an apple.\nResources for nutrition: Book: How not to diet\nBook: The Obesity Code\nMy favourite earl grey\nExercise My goal with exercise is to lose fat and gain muscles - I don’t even bother with using scale. At the time of writing this I can do deadlift 100kg, bench press 50kg, squat 70kg.\nWeight lifting makes back pain go away. Always stretch after work out. Keep your water and mug far away from desk, so that you have to make a break from work to have a drink. Plus do some steps on the way. If you never ever used any of gym equipment, such as bars or benches, hire a personal trainer for a few sessions - they will show to you how to exercise, how to use equipment and how to make an actual progress. Weight lifting gets really fun when you find your weight. The general rule is to find a weight which can be repeated 6 to 8 times. Anything less is too heavy, anything more is too light. I tend to burn 400-600 calories per hour in the gym. 3 times a week at the gym is a minimum. Aim for at one hour a day of moderate exercise a day e.g. brisk walking. The body of compensates over several days after calorie burning event by e.g. makes us hungrier and slowing metabolism. But it’s only able to do it to certain number of calories. One hour a day seems to be the number which works for me and is quite conventional.

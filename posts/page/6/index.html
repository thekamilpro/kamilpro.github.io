Yes, yesterday was my birthday. Another great year has passed but this time with a wonderful woman next to my side. It’s unbelievable how many good things have happened in the last 365 days. I could now start telling you and show off… but not on this occasion, this is a celebration time! On the days like these, I think about changing my settings to neutral, stop rushing and just sit calmly and wait for what comes next…anything… No....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2016-08-08 21:58:56 +0000 UTC'>2016-08-08</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;Kamil</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to 27 was a great number" href=https://kamilpro.com/27-was-a-great-number/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2>Apps, and their impact on the smart phone</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>When we buy a new phone, manufacturers advertise it always as a super fast with superb colours and a long lasting battery.
Usually it’s true, which we can confirm just after the unboxing ritual when we hold our brand new device in the hands.
It’s shiny, without scratches, with a specific smell, plus it’s really fast and battery lasts very long.
Until… we actually start using the phone, by this I mean installing the whole lot of our favourite apps....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2016-08-07 09:45:31 +0000 UTC'>2016-08-07</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;Kamil</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Apps, and their impact on the smart phone" href=https://kamilpro.com/apps-impact-smart-phone/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2>Overloaded</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>Recently I’ve been writing about information overload.

Oh well, I have overloaded myself recently.
I slept 24 hours over the last 2 days! From 8 PM till 8AM. Children don’t sleep that much. My last 2 days had been like: Wake up, shower, work, coffee, home, dinner, coffee, sleep.
Exciting, isn’t it?

Hundreds, maybe thousands of times.
How many time afterwards I have realised that my belief was completely wrong. Like 100% wrong. Like back to front feeling.
I think the most difficult is the moment of making a decision. That very moment when it’s time to commit to a long standing decision.

One of them is self-investment. Something what I do entirely for myself, because I am convinced that it will be beneficial to me, eventually.
At the beginning of my IT journey, I sacrificed a lot of time. There were whole weekends with computer as well as late nights during a week.

Morning coffee. I simply cannot start the day without a cup of a real coffee. That was the reason why I bought the actual bean to coffee machine, because of the taste and smell of real coffee. Prepared in the exact way I like it.
This week I’ve ran out of the time in the morning and couldn’t make my favourite coffee, so I used the instant one....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2016-07-29 22:35:35 +0000 UTC'>2016-07-29</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;Kamil</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Routine" href=https://kamilpro.com/routine/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2>Rely</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>Trust, hope, relationship. Words which make us feel good, because we can rely on others.
I remember when sometime ago, I needed to push a new software to about 50 computers. As always, with that kind of operation, there was a very limited time to do this.
In normal situation, there is deployment solution in place – a server which distributes the software in an automated way. Obviously, as an administrator I need to prepare the whole process – finding installers, commands and switches for these software and even writing scripts....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2016-07-28 19:49:01 +0000 UTC'>2016-07-28</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;Kamil</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Rely" href=https://kamilpro.com/rely/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2>No pain, no gain.</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>How many times petty things have ruined your day?

We can take a lot. Our minds are like massive hard drives which store data in a form of memories, feelings and thoughts.
Did you know that a human is able to erase certain bad memories or push them right back, deep in our subconscious?

      <description>Code fails - whether because of reasons out of our control, or because we didn&amp;rsquo;t consider the situation it might fail. Expired credentials, timeout connections, lack of permissions go genuine software bug - each of these are potential problem which might fall our code over. And if we don&amp;rsquo;t handle the error, our script will simply throw and terminate. It&amp;rsquo;s certainly not desired state.
In this video I&amp;rsquo;ll show you different ways PowerShell can error, how to debug such errors and how to handle them - so that we are in control.</description>

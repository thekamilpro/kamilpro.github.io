      <description>The World talks constantly about DevOps, CI/CI pipelines, automation - which great, but where to actually start? Especially when you&amp;rsquo;ve been writing PowerShell which is often used as automation language, but not actually as programming language?
In this video I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to create a build pipeline for PowerShell module, from scratch. We will start from creating a project, creating new Git repository, pushing code to repository to finally create a pipeline which takes care of building the module, versioning it and finally publishing.</description>

      <description>Organising all files, scripts and functions required to build a module might give one a headache. PowerShell doesn&amp;rsquo;t come with native way of building the module, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t make our job easier.
Hence, we&amp;rsquo;re going to use ModuleBuilder from PowerShell community so that the way we organise the code is predictable and used widely across other PowerShell projects.
In this video I&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through the process of preparing, organising and finally building the module.</description>

      <title>PowerShell Module and Manifest- create and configure your tools</title>

      <description>The more PowerShell code you write results in more and more scripts. Often you have multiple scripts managing one domain or application. What in situation when scripts start to use other scripts to work, creating so called dependency?
PowerShell module is the answer - it&amp;rsquo;s the native way of bundling in multiple functions together as a single file. And the best comes with Module&amp;rsquo;s Manifest, a file that describes things like version of your module, requirements for it to run, author&amp;rsquo;s details etc.</description>

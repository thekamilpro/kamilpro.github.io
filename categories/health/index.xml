      <description>I Stopped drinking coffee three months ago.
The worst was the first week, which I can compare to having a hangover, but without the sensitivity to light and feeling dehydrated. For a week, I suffered from headaches, nausea, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating.
There were times of the day, like 9 in the morning, when I needed my cup of coffee to stop my body from screaming for it and to get that energy boost.</description>

      <description>For several years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on my health - with goal of staying healthy as long as possible. It all started with working on sleep, which was followed by jogging, nutrition etc. where at this point it has become a part of my identity.
The goal here is to keep this post as a baseline for comparing myself in the future, how much I drifted or improved over time, and then share to the any other person who wants work on themselves.</description>

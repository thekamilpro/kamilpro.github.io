This is 20th and last lesson in the course – and my aim here is to show you various paths you can take your PowerShell journey to.
I’m going to show what else you can do within PowerShell itself, as well how to keep up-to-day plus – what other doors writing code has opened for you – I’d love to hear back about this!
I hope you’ve enjoyed the course so far and it will be helped you in some way – either solve a problem, got promotion, or simply learnt something new.</description></item><item><title>PowerShell for IT Professionals [#19] – Websites and APIs</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-for-it-professionals-19-websites-and-apis/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Nov 2020 20:57:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-for-it-professionals-19-websites-and-apis/</guid><description>PowerShell is a great server automation tool, but what about Internet and any other web served services?
As it turns out, PowerShell is great in scrapping websites and consuming APIs – and it’s been one of the main development areas of the tool in the last couple of years.
In this lesson we are going to see how to use PowerShell to download files, scrap websites, discover links.
We will then use an API of PasswordPusher (pwpush.</description></item><item><title>PowerShell for IT Professionals [#18] – Working with text strings</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-for-it-professionals-18-working-with-text-strings/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Nov 2020 17:33:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-for-it-professionals-18-working-with-text-strings/</guid><description>Although PowerShell treats everything as object - including text strings - working with text might be particularly difficult - at least when first approached.
In this lesson we are going to have a closer look at what is possible with built in text methods and see how these can help us e.g. by extracting a substring of text.
PowerShell can also be great at parsing log files - we will use Select-String to quickly filter out the lines of text with the phrase we are looking for e.</description></item><item><title>PowerShell for IT Professionals [#17] – Scripting part 4 – parameters, running remotely and formatting</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-for-it-professionals-17-scripting-part-4-parameters-running-remotely-and-formatting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Oct 2020 18:32:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-for-it-professionals-17-scripting-part-4-parameters-running-remotely-and-formatting/</guid><description>In the last part of scripting series, we will make the script to be able to query remote machines, e.g. servers.
We will also check how to add parameters to the script (and configure the default value of parameter) so that user will able to pass the parameter name like in a standard PowerShell cmdlet.
Finally, we are going to format the script so that it looks more reliable and make some refactoring so that the logic is simpler.</description></item><item><title>PowerShell for IT Professionals [#16] – Scripting part 3 – Add-Member and network</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-for-it-professionals-16-scripting-part-3-add-member-and-network/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Oct 2020 19:12:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-for-it-professionals-16-scripting-part-3-add-member-and-network/</guid><description>In this lesson we are taking our script further by adding details about IP configuration and last installed hotfixes.
But it turns out, the networking information is not that shallow as it seems at the first glance – thus I’ll show you how to retrieve the information from the configuration.
We will also look on how to reuse our already created object so that we don’t need to duplicate code.</description></item><item><title>PowerShell for IT Professionals [#15] – Scripting part 2 – IF and psobject</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-for-it-professionals-15-scripting-part-2-if-and-psobject/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Oct 2020 17:16:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-for-it-professionals-15-scripting-part-2-if-and-psobject/</guid><description>In this lesson we carry on writing the scripting by gathering requirements and putting them together as comments in code.
Then we will retrieve OS information with the help of WMI and display it on the screen with Write-Host.
Although using Write-Host is easy to use, it doesn’t really allow us to do very much e.g. we cannot export information to the CSV, therefore we change it and start using custom PSObject – that way our script will start returning information like a regular PowerShell command.</description></item><item><title>PowerShell for IT Professionals [#14] – Scripting – Hello World!</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-for-it-professionals-14-scripting-hello-world/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Sep 2020 13:00:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-for-it-professionals-14-scripting-hello-world/</guid><description>In this lesson we will be preparing our workstation for writing PowerShell scripts. We will start by enabling RSAT and then install Visual Studio Code which is a recommended and free PowerShell code editor.
We will then have a look at the basic function of VS Code and create a simple “Hello World” script.
Exercises If you haven’t followed along, you definitely would like to install VS Code and create a *.</description></item><item><title>PowerShell for IT Professionals [#13] – Is PowerShell secure?</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-for-it-professionals-13-is-powershell-secure/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Sep 2020 16:09:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-for-it-professionals-13-is-powershell-secure/</guid><description>In this lesson we will have a look on PowerShell built in security features and how it differs from e.g. BAT files.
We will then have a look how execution policy can help to control on what basis the PowerShell scripts can be executed.
At the end, we will configure some GPOs to control the execution and transcription of scripts.</description></item><item><title>PowerShell for IT Professionals [#12] – WMI – Windows Management Instrumentation</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-for-it-professionals-12-wmi-windows-management-instrumentation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Sep 2020 16:27:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-for-it-professionals-12-wmi-windows-management-instrumentation/</guid><description>In this lesson we learn how to use PowerShell to access WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation), so that we can gain often hidden or obscure information.
We will then use WMI Explorer graphical tool to ease discovering all possible classes and instances that WMI provides.
Finally, we will use WMI queries to add another level of granularity in GPO so that we can target very specific computers in it.
Exercises There’s a WMI class that lists all the installed software – find it and list all currently installed software with PowerShell.</description></item><item><title>PowerShell for IT Professionals [#11] – Variables</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-for-it-professionals-11-variables/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Aug 2020 10:39:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-for-it-professionals-11-variables/</guid><description>In this lesson we’re going to learn how what Variables are, why it’s good to use them and how to actually create them. We will then assign various values to variables to and use them solely, and in parameters.
We will also have a look at foreach loop so that we can e.g. ping multiple computers using single variable with multiple objects in it.
Exercises Use Get-Command to find all commands that allow you to manage variables.</description></item><item><title>PowerShell for IT Professionals [#10] – Remote management with PowerShell</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-for-it-professionals-10-remote-management-with-powershell/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Aug 2020 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-for-it-professionals-10-remote-management-with-powershell/</guid><description>In this lesson we’re going to learn how to do one-to-one and one-to-many remote management with PowerShell. There’s no need for telnet, ssh or psexec as PowerShell has its own protocol that’s built in right into Windows. We will look at how to create interactive sessions and send commands to multiple servers at once.

Can you tell what’s a difference between ConvertTo-CSV and Export-CSV commands
We often need to review event logs – which command would allow you to retrieve event logs?</description></item><item><title>Deploying software with GPO</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/deploying-software-with-gpo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Mar 2020 14:25:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/deploying-software-with-gpo/</guid><description>Having software consistently deployed across the fleet of computers is one of the key points that can be automated.
If I have a choice (and it makes sense), I will always choose GPO over any other solution because it’s embedded into Active Directory thus not requiring installation, learning and maintenance of additional management tool.
MSI – Software Installation One of the main advantages of MSI installers is that in 99% of cases you can just use the “Software Installation” option in GPO, and GPO will take care of the silent installation.</description></item><item><title>Prepare Hyper-V template of Windows Server 2016/2019</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/prepare-hyper-v-template-of-windows-server-2016-2019/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Mar 2020 10:52:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/prepare-hyper-v-template-of-windows-server-2016-2019/</guid><description>Deploying a new server is always fun! Well, at least the part after ISO download, installation, patching. Having said that, why not create a template so that you jump right into the fun?
So we are essentially going to create a preconfigured VHDX file that can be attached to the newly created VM, and it will take you straight to the login screen.

What does it mean to automate? Simply put, is to remove a person from equation in order to complete the task. It can go as far as automating the whole process, or just part of it. The main goal here is to release the resource – that is a person’s time and energy – and redirect it toward something more valuable.</description></item><item><title>Backup Exec – cataloging multiple tapes with a single tape drive</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/backup-exec-cataloging-multiple-tapes-with-a-single-tape-drive/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Sep 2018 20:33:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/backup-exec-cataloging-multiple-tapes-with-a-single-tape-drive/</guid><description>Recently I’ve had a request to restore a certain backup from the old backup tapes. We’ve had a new Backup exec installation which didn’t have the catalogue/record of these tapes nor the actual tape drive to recover them – I knew it was going to be one in the world task.

The ESXis are on two completely separate networks. VM size is 5.5 TB, with one file being 5TB.
The problem: VM cannot be started due to maxed out resources. There’s no NAS or any other means of storage where the files could be transferred to. From previous experience, I knew that transfer over SSH or USB would be well too slow, as the task was time critical.</description></item><item><title>Resolve IP and DNS with Powershell tool</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-tool-resolve-ip-and-dns/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Apr 2018 21:40:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/powershell-tool-resolve-ip-and-dns/</guid><description>I’ve been asked to prepare a simple tool which would:
Resolve IP address or DNS Return all results to table Import addresses from a file The reason behind was to check how IP/DNS records change over the period of time, therefore there was a need for something like that:

Often you receive a request to do a certain action with a bunch of accounts, and (obviously) the list provided contains the full names rather usernames. Pain to do it manually, but yet we can utilise Powershell here.
What you need: CSV file, with only one column, and the header of the column must be called “Name”, if you prefer to use something different, simply amend Name in line 6 to reflect your header.</description></item><item><title>Add any drivers to Windows – on example of GPU drivers</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/add-any-drivers-to-windows-on-example-of-gpu-drivers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2017 18:53:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/add-any-drivers-to-windows-on-example-of-gpu-drivers/</guid><description>Today we are going to inject drivers into the Windows image with the help of built-in tools in Windows.

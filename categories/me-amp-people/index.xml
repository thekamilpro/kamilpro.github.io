Same symbolic time of the year.
I find it perfect to review the past 12 months and have a think about it.
I broke it down into three sections – professional, personal and what didn’t work out. So, let’s go!
Professional Learnt PowerShell – I think it was the biggest achievement career wise this year. It’s hard to put this in formalised matter, or any sort of figure – but the change of my mindset is the biggest one.</description></item><item><title>Blog is changing</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/blog-is-changing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2016 07:30:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/blog-is-changing/</guid><description>My idea of this place has been changing since I’ve brought it up. It wasn’t even my first blog, in fact, it was a third one. But the main difference was I wanted to get to the world this time. Don’t just write for the sake of writing.
Very first version of this website was more like a business card or a CV, rather than a blog. I don’t say how proud I was, but also must admit how wrong I was.</description></item><item><title>On time – to be or not to be</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/on-time-to-be-or-not-to-be/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Aug 2016 21:39:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/on-time-to-be-or-not-to-be/</guid><description>We live in a time driven world. We to try to maximise 24 hours every day. Time wasting is not an option.
Therefore we try to squeeze as much as possible in a schedule. Beginning from very morning.
Every morning we start fairly the same, fulfilling daily ritual. Make up, news, coffee – ready, steady, go – everything what make us ready to make a public appearance .
So it’s 8 am, and we are certainly ready to leave.</description></item><item><title>Less is more</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/less-is-more/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Aug 2016 17:59:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/less-is-more/</guid><description>&lt;p>We live in a cram-full world, full of anything we could possibly imagine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having a choice is a great thing – I can pick stuff which really suits myself. In case I need, say, a teal corner 4 seater bed sofa, it’s just a matter of time and money I am prepared to spend, until I get one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But what happens when I don’t have too many options? When there are 2 things which really suit me, but say, I’ve got space just for 1 sofa?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The kill joy, ready made type</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/the-kill-joy-ready-made-type/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Aug 2016 22:02:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/the-kill-joy-ready-made-type/</guid><description>What an easy life when you are an ignorant!
Dull face. Knows all football matches. Actually, this fellow made an art from sitting in front of a TV with a 4-for-£4 pack and trying to prove that this is his life passion. I think I could made another passion from observing clouds in the garden. I would watch them for hours while they change their shapes, move around in the sky, still sitting in the chair and observing them pointlessly.</description></item><item><title>27 was a great number</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/27-was-a-great-number/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Aug 2016 21:58:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/27-was-a-great-number/</guid><description>but I’m certain that 28 will be even better!
Yes, yesterday was my birthday. Another great year has passed but this time with a wonderful woman next to my side. It&amp;#8217;s unbelievable how many good things have happened in the last 365 days. I could now start telling you and show off&amp;#8230; but not on this occasion, this is a celebration time! On the days like these, I think about changing my settings to neutral, stop rushing and just sit calmly and wait for what comes next&amp;#8230;anything&amp;#8230; No.</description></item><item><title>Whatever floats your boat…</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/whatever-floats-your-boat/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2016 21:57:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/whatever-floats-your-boat/</guid><description>How many times I’ve put my all enthusiasm into something, being convinced that it was the right thing.
Hundreds, maybe thousands of times.
How many time afterwards I have realised that my belief was completely wrong. Like 100% wrong. Like back to front feeling.
I think the most difficult is the moment of making a decision. That very moment when it’s time to commit to a long standing decision. The second when it’s time to reveal self and go public.</description></item><item><title>Headphones</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/headphones/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2016 21:25:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/headphones/</guid><description>At home while writing, photo editing or just for fun. At work when I need to focus and be effective. At the time when I need a boost or completely opposite – when looking for a way to calm down. Headphones accompany me throughout the day.
There is something about sound that keeps me going. When I need to keep up and focus on something certain, I listen to some energy energetic music.</description></item><item><title>Routine</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/routine/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2016 22:35:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/routine/</guid><description>They say that habits are our second nature. Things which we do repeatedly are like pre-programmed functions which trigger specific time or action.
Morning coffee. I simply cannot start the day without a cup of a real coffee. That was the reason why I bought the actual bean to coffee machine, because of the taste and smell of real coffee. Prepared in the exact way I like it.
This week I’ve ran out of the time in the morning and couldn’t make my favourite coffee, so I used the instant one.</description></item><item><title>Rely</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/rely/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jul 2016 19:49:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/rely/</guid><description>Trust, hope, relationship. Words which make us feel good, because we can rely on others.
I remember when sometime ago, I needed to push a new software to about 50 computers. As always, with that kind of operation, there was a very limited time to do this.
In normal situation, there is deployment solution in place – a server which distributes the software in an automated way. Obviously, as an administrator I need to prepare the whole process – finding installers, commands and switches for these software and even writing scripts.</description></item><item><title>No pain, no gain.</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/no-pain-no-gain/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jul 2016 21:09:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/no-pain-no-gain/</guid><description>How many times petty things have ruined your day? Or people? Or, even, yourself? Just admit it.
We can take a lot. Our minds are like massive hard drives which store data in a form of memories, feelings and thoughts.
Did you know that a human is able to erase certain bad memories or push them right back, deep in our subconscious? For example, women are going though unbelievable pain while giving a birth.</description></item><item><title>Share</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/share/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jul 2016 22:05:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/share/</guid><description>I remember like when I was 10-ish and had been trying to fix my first computer. There was no Internet, there was no one really to ask for advice or share the knowledge with me. It took me days, and at the very end, I found that I didn’t have essential drivers to make my computer really usable. Did I mention that the Internet wasn’t available yet?
I had to figure this out, and it took me ridiculous amount of time to achieve such a basic task like reinstalling an operating system.</description></item><item><title>Influence</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/influence/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2016 11:34:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/influence/</guid><description>A friend visited us yesterday. There was a nice cake, coffee, dinner and conversations thoughtout the night.
Suddenly the ladies started to talk about navigation apps on mobile devices. K. was complaining about high data usage during browsing on the Internet. J. suggested her to try Here maps as it is free and allows to download the maps, therefore data is completely not needed for navigation to work, plus it is really accurate app.</description></item><item><title>Do something different</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/do-something-different/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jul 2016 15:41:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/do-something-different/</guid><description>Sometimes I am so deep in my thoughts that I have no notion of what time of the day is. I know I should be doing something, anything but wasting my time… Life is too short to waste time but all the possibilities somehow don’t even cross my mind.
Do you get the same feeling where you can literally stare at the wall opposite while the time stands still? It’s a horrible feeling.</description></item><item><title>Silence</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/silence/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jul 2016 19:33:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/silence/</guid><description>The world is loud. It’s shouting though. Being expressive and extrovert is the key to the success this times. It doesn’t matter whether the person is good or positive.
I think we’ve got used to being bombarded on daily basis, everyone and everything want to share with us. It’s up to us whether we’d like to take any of these screams on board, or just ignore them. And obviously, the question is – how much we can accumulate.</description></item><item><title>The joy of crossing</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/the-joy-of-crossing/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jul 2016 20:37:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/the-joy-of-crossing/</guid><description>I’ve got a good memory. I can remember different things quite easily, organise and plan them in my mind. A serious and complex task is not a big deal to me, as long as I can understand it. At times I can be annoying (I guess some might say that), by asking many questions, as understanding of each step is a baseline to completing every task correctly.
But there is something magical in writing down the tasks.</description></item><item><title>Process</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/process/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2016 19:58:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/process/</guid><description>“We are in the process of management change” “The company is in the process of implementing new policies” etc. etc. This is quite a normal term and we don’t pay attention to it, instead we just take this information on board. Whether we like the changes, it’s entirely up to us, despite the fact often we don’t notice any changes in practice. But people are going through “process of a change” as well.</description></item><item><title>A winner!</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/a-winner/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jul 2016 21:48:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/a-winner/</guid><description>We are all winners, undoubtedly. Whatever we do, whenever we create an action – we must win.
Well, not really.
Since the childhood we are taught and pushed to be the best. Get a grade A or B, at least C. Like the D, E or even F don’t exist. We are pushed through countless tests and exams, and being challenged on daily basis.
And there is always somebody, who in a good faith has to say that “you won” even though we actually did not.</description></item><item><title>Spam</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/spam/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2016 21:30:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/spam/</guid><description>Spam. Spam everywhere. There isn’t a day without it. Without bombarding us with plenty of information. Way too much of information.
While the original – email spam – is well handled by email providers, the other sources are not.
On social media – there is plenty of shared stuff which someone (I hope so!) thought was worth of sharing. News is all over the place – starting from daily free newspapers, through radio and TV and ending up on the Internet.</description></item><item><title>Let’s get retar… Started!</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/lets-get-retar-started/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jul 2016 21:51:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/lets-get-retar-started/</guid><description>Thoughts. Ideas. Things which happen in my head for hours, days, sometimes even longer. My brain is constantly thinking, analysing and making decisions, almost 24/7. The problem is – I don’t share… but I really want to.
Some time ago I’ve made a decision to create my own website where I could share my thoughts and where they would stay like carved in the stone.
When I reflect on the past year (this is since I brought up my website) I have published less than 10 (TEN!</description></item><item><title>Free ride</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/free-ride/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2016 12:49:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/free-ride/</guid><description>&lt;p>Nothing really makes me angrier than so called friends who remember about you only when they need something.

Sometimes the way how negative situations happen describe the way our day, week, life look like. The way we are.
Funnily enough, very often those things or people are just happening around us, the way we often don’t even notice it. We often can only notice the result of all those things.</description></item><item><title>Hello world!</title><link>https://kamilpro.com/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Apr 2015 06:09:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kamilpro.com/hello-world/</guid><description>Every proper project should have the “Hello world!”, so does mine ;).</description></item></channel></rss>

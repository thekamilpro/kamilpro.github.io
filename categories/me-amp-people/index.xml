&lt;/div>Here we are, again. Same symbolic time of the year.
I find it perfect to review the past 12 months and have a think about it.
I broke it down into three sections – professional, personal and what didn’t work out. So, let’s go!
Professional Learnt PowerShell – I think it was the biggest achievement career wise this year. It’s hard to put this in formalised matter, or any sort of figure – but the change of my mindset is the biggest one.</description></item><item><title>Blog is changing</title><link>https://kamilpro.github.io/blog-is-changing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2016 07:30:13 +0000</pubDate><author>Kamil</author><guid>https://kamilpro.github.io/blog-is-changing/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>My idea of this place has been changing since I’ve brought it up. It wasn’t even my first blog, in fact, it was a third one. But the main difference was I wanted to get to the world this time. Don’t just write for the sake of writing.
Very first version of this website was more like a business card or a CV, rather than a blog. I don’t say how proud I was, but also must admit how wrong I was.</description></item><item><title>On time – to be or not to be</title><link>https://kamilpro.github.io/on-time-to-be-or-not-to-be/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Aug 2016 21:39:06 +0000</pubDate><author>Kamil</author><guid>https://kamilpro.github.io/on-time-to-be-or-not-to-be/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>We live in a time driven world. We to try to maximise 24 hours every day. Time wasting is not an option.
Therefore we try to squeeze as much as possible in a schedule. Beginning from very morning.
Every morning we start fairly the same, fulfilling daily ritual. Make up, news, coffee – ready, steady, go – everything what make us ready to make a public appearance .
So it’s 8 am, and we are certainly ready to leave.</description></item><item><title>Less is more</title><link>https://kamilpro.github.io/less-is-more/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Aug 2016 17:59:54 +0000</pubDate><author>Kamil</author><guid>https://kamilpro.github.io/less-is-more/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div><p>We live in a cram-full world, full of anything we could possibly imagine.</p>
<p>Having a choice is a great thing – I can pick stuff which really suits myself. In case I need, say, a teal corner 4 seater bed sofa, it’s just a matter of time and money I am prepared to spend, until I get one.</p>
<p>But what happens when I don’t have too many options? When there are 2 things which really suit me, but say, I’ve got space just for 1 sofa?</p>]]></description></item><item><title>The kill joy, ready made type</title><link>https://kamilpro.github.io/the-kill-joy-ready-made-type/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Aug 2016 22:02:19 +0000</pubDate><author>Kamil</author><guid>https://kamilpro.github.io/the-kill-joy-ready-made-type/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>What an easy life when you are an ignorant!
Dull face. Knows all football matches. Actually, this fellow made an art from sitting in front of a TV with a 4-for-£4 pack and trying to prove that this is his life passion. I think I could made another passion from observing clouds in the garden. I would watch them for hours while they change their shapes, move around in the sky, still sitting in the chair and observing them pointlessly.</description></item><item><title>27 was a great number</title><link>https://kamilpro.github.io/27-was-a-great-number/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Aug 2016 21:58:56 +0000</pubDate><author>Kamil</author><guid>https://kamilpro.github.io/27-was-a-great-number/</guid><description><![CDATA[but I’m certain that 28 will be even better!
Yes, yesterday was my birthday. Another great year has passed but this time with a wonderful woman next to my side. It&#8217;s unbelievable how many good things have happened in the last 365 days. I could now start telling you and show off&#8230; but not on this occasion, this is a celebration time! On the days like these, I think about changing my settings to neutral, stop rushing and just sit calmly and wait for what comes next&#8230;anything&#8230; No.]]></description></item><item><title>Whatever floats your boat…</title><link>https://kamilpro.github.io/whatever-floats-your-boat/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2016 21:57:25 +0000</pubDate><author>Kamil</author><guid>https://kamilpro.github.io/whatever-floats-your-boat/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>How many times I’ve put my all enthusiasm into something, being convinced that it was the right thing.
Hundreds, maybe thousands of times.
How many time afterwards I have realised that my belief was completely wrong. Like 100% wrong. Like back to front feeling.
I think the most difficult is the moment of making a decision. That very moment when it’s time to commit to a long standing decision. The second when it’s time to reveal self and go public.</description></item><item><title>Headphones</title><link>https://kamilpro.github.io/headphones/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2016 21:25:29 +0000</pubDate><author>Kamil</author><guid>https://kamilpro.github.io/headphones/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>At home while writing, photo editing or just for fun. At work when I need to focus and be effective. At the time when I need a boost or completely opposite – when looking for a way to calm down. Headphones accompany me throughout the day.
There is something about sound that keeps me going. When I need to keep up and focus on something certain, I listen to some energy energetic music.</description></item><item><title>Routine</title><link>https://kamilpro.github.io/routine/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2016 22:35:35 +0000</pubDate><author>Kamil</author><guid>https://kamilpro.github.io/routine/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>They say that habits are our second nature. Things which we do repeatedly are like pre-programmed functions which trigger specific time or action.
Morning coffee. I simply cannot start the day without a cup of a real coffee. That was the reason why I bought the actual bean to coffee machine, because of the taste and smell of real coffee. Prepared in the exact way I like it.
This week I’ve ran out of the time in the morning and couldn’t make my favourite coffee, so I used the instant one.</description></item><item><title>Rely</title><link>https://kamilpro.github.io/rely/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jul 2016 19:49:01 +0000</pubDate><author>Kamil</author><guid>https://kamilpro.github.io/rely/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>Trust, hope, relationship. Words which make us feel good, because we can rely on others.
I remember when sometime ago, I needed to push a new software to about 50 computers. As always, with that kind of operation, there was a very limited time to do this.
In normal situation, there is deployment solution in place – a server which distributes the software in an automated way. Obviously, as an administrator I need to prepare the whole process – finding installers, commands and switches for these software and even writing scripts.</description></item></channel></rss>

&lt;/div>This will be a high level experience I’ve been gaining whenever automating manual processes.
What does it mean to automate? Simply put, is to remove a person from equation in order to complete the task. It can go as far as automating the whole process, or just part of it. The main goal here is to release the resource – that is a person’s time and energy – and redirect it toward something more valuable.</description></item><item><title>Sysadmin’s tools – what I have installed on my laptop</title><link>https://kprocyszyn.github.io/sysadmins-tools-what-i-have-installed-on-my-laptop/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jan 2019 20:40:21 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://kprocyszyn.github.io/sysadmins-tools-what-i-have-installed-on-my-laptop/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>We need tools to make our work. Either it’s notepad and paper, a hammer (for server’s hard reset… just joking) or some sophisticated and bespoke peace of hardware – we as professionals need tools to make our work better, or even possible.
Since working as IT person, there are many software tools I need to do my day to day tasks, thus here’s the list of pieces of software I’ve been finding useful.</description></item><item><title>Do you even back up?</title><link>https://kprocyszyn.github.io/do-you-even-back-up/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Oct 2016 20:11:31 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://kprocyszyn.github.io/do-you-even-back-up/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>It’s early Monday – the time between the coffee and checking emails – you realise everything’s gone. Files. Videos of your children since they were born. Years of company’s spreadsheets. Gone. It’s not going to be a good week, for sure.
There are 2 kinds of people… According to one of the IT jokes, there are two kinds of people: ones who do back up, and the ones who will.</description></item><item><title>I’m really missing time before the Internet.</title><link>https://kprocyszyn.github.io/im-really-missing-time-internet/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Aug 2016 19:47:22 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://kprocyszyn.github.io/im-really-missing-time-internet/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>Because software was working without the need of downloading tons of patches. Why do we actually need to update software in the first place?
In the past, the only way to obtain a software was by delivering the physical media to the recipient. There was a cost of media itself and shipment (and probably much more of which I’m not aware of), it couldn’t be cheap. While comparing to the current times, it is just a matter of uploading an update to the server and push to users.</description></item><item><title>Apps, and their impact on the smart phone</title><link>https://kprocyszyn.github.io/apps-impact-smart-phone/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Aug 2016 09:45:31 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://kprocyszyn.github.io/apps-impact-smart-phone/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>When we buy a new phone, manufacturers advertise it always as a super fast with superb colours and a long lasting battery.
Usually it’s true, which we can confirm just after the unboxing ritual when we hold our brand new device in the hands.
It’s shiny, without scratches, with a specific smell, plus it’s really fast and battery lasts very long.
Until… we actually start using the phone, by this I mean installing the whole lot of our favourite apps.</description></item><item><title>Post-Smartphone era, yet?</title><link>https://kprocyszyn.github.io/post-smartphone-era-yet/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2016 17:00:23 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://kprocyszyn.github.io/post-smartphone-era-yet/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

And how to avoid unnecessary money and time waste? You need somebody who thinks out of the box, is determined and the most important – has tons of experience. Below you can see how I was gaining experience and how it helped me to be where I am right now.
I always considered myself as the guy who’s got practical knowledge.</description></item></channel></rss>

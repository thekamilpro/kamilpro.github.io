There are obviously other tricks like focusing the view on the eyes, cutting slightly on the top of the hair or so called rule of the thirds – but that’s additions which enhance the portrait.\nEyes, face, action, emotions and expression – that’s the parts of the good portrait. And if you’ve got any other distraction like jewellery, objects or people on the background – then you are ruining your photo.\nOnce again, less distractions is more for the overall photo.\nAnd there are hundreds of other examples like that – less in your CV, will allow the employer to focus on the most important parts of the CV. Doing only 1 task at the time rather than multitasking 10 at once will ensure that you will do the task better and faster, without the headache.\nLess is more, it’s always better to focus on quality.
